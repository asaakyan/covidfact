Various forms of life exist , such as plants , animals , fungi , protists , archaea , and bacteria . Hominins , the earliest direct ancestors of the human clade , rose sometime during the latter part of the Miocene epoch ; the precise time marking the first hominins is broadly debated over a current range of 13 to 4 mya . The plants and animals of the Miocene were fairly modern . All species of animals , land plants and most fungi are multicellular , as are many algae , whereas a few organisms are partially uni - and partially multicellular , like slime molds and social amoebae such as the genus Dictyostelium . The earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago , during the Eoarchean Era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean Eon . This event drove a rapid diversification of life forms on Earth that produced most of the major phyla known today ; and it marked the end of the Proterozoic Eon and the beginning of the Cambrian Period of the Paleozoic Era . Life remained mostly small and microscopic until about 580 million years ago , when complex multicellular life arose , developed over time , and culminated in the Cambrian Explosion about 541 million years ago .

In international affairs , Macmillan rebuilt the special relationship with the United States from the wreckage of the Suez Crisis ( of which he had been one of the architects ) , and redrew the world map by decolonising sub-Saharan Africa . Reconfiguring the nation 's defences to meet the realities of the nuclear age , he ended National Service , strengthened the nuclear forces by acquiring Polaris , and pioneered the Nuclear Test Ban with the United States and the Soviet Union . When Eden resigned in 1957 after the Suez Crisis , Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister . Belatedly recognising the dangers of strategic dependence , he sought a new role for Britain in Europe , but his unwillingness to disclose United States nuclear secrets to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom 's entry into the European Economic Community . Near the end of his premiership , his government was rocked by the Vassall and Profumo scandals , which seemed to symbolise for the rebellious youth of the 1960s the moral decay of the British establishment . Benefiting from favourable international conditions , he presided over an age of affluence , marked by low unemployment and high if uneven growth . After his resignation , Macmillan lived out a long retirement as an elder statesman . In his Bedford speech in July 1957 he told the nation they had ` never had it so good ' , but warned of the dangers of inflation , summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s . Macmillan served in the Grenadier Guards during the First World War . As a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition , haunted by memories of the Great Depression , he believed in the post-war settlement and the necessity of a mixed economy , championing a Keynesian strategy of public investment to maintain demand and pursuing corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth . The Conservatives were re-elected in 1959 with an increased majority on an electioneering budget . He was wounded three times , most severely in September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme . After losing his seat in 1929 , he regained it in 1931 , soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees , and against appeasement . He spent the rest of the war in a military hospital unable to walk , and suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life . He was as trenchant a critic of his successors in his old age as he had been of his predecessors in his youth . After the war Macmillan joined his family business , then entered Parliament in the 1924 General Election , for the northern industrial constituency of Stockton-on-Tees . Maurice Harold Macmillan , 1st Earl of Stockton , ( 10 February 1894 -- 29 December 1986 ) was a British Conservative politician and statesman who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 10 January 1957 to 19 October 1963 . Rising to high office during the Second World War as a protégé of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Macmillan then served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Churchill 's successor Sir Anthony Eden .

Historians commonly divide the war into three phases separated by truces : the Edwardian Era War ( 1337 -- 1360 ) ; the Caroline War ( 1369 -- 1389 ) ; and the Lancastrian War ( 1415 -- 1453 ) . The war marked both the height of chivalry and its subsequent decline , and the development of strong national identities in both countries . Local conflicts in neighbouring areas , which were contemporarily related to the war , including the War of the Breton Succession ( 1341 -- 1364 ) , the Castilian Civil War ( 1366 -- 1369 ) , the War of the Two Peters ( 1356 -- 1375 ) in Aragon , and the 1383 -- 85 Crisis in Portugal , were availed by the parties to advance their agendas . The dissatisfaction of English nobles , resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings , became a factor leading to the civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses ( 1455 -- 1487 ) . Later historians adopted the term `` Hundred Years ' War '' as a historiography periodization to encompass all of these events , thus constructing the longest military conflict in European history . The war owes its historical significance to multiple factors . Several overwhelming English victories in the war -- especially at Crecy , Poitiers , and Agincourt -- raised the prospects of an ultimate English triumph . Starting in 1429 , decisive French victories at Orléans , Patay , Formigny , and Castillon concluded the war in favour of France , with England permanently losing most of its major possessions on the continent . Although primarily a dynastic conflict , the war gave impetus to ideas of French and English nationalism . The Hundred Years ' War was a series of conflicts waged from 1337 to 1453 by the House of Plantagenet , rulers of the Kingdom of England , against the House of Valois , rulers of the Kingdom of France , over the succession of the French throne . Each side drew many allies into the war .

Countering these threats , Castro formed an alliance with the Soviet Union and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba , sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis -- a defining incident of the Cold War -- in 1962 . These actions , coupled with Castro 's leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1979 to 1983 and Cuba 's medical internationalism , increased Cuba 's profile on the world stage . After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia , he planned the overthrow of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista , launching a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953 . Policies introducing central economic planning and expanding healthcare and education were accompanied by state control of the press and the suppression of internal dissent . He was decorated with various international awards and significantly influenced various individuals and groups across the world . Returning to Cuba , Castro took a key role in the Cuban Revolution by leading the Movement in a guerrilla war against Batista 's forces from the Sierra Maestra . After a year 's imprisonment , he traveled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group , the 26th of July Movement , with his brother Raúl Castro and Che Guevara .

In the 2000s he forged alliances in the Latin American `` pink tide '' -- namely with Hugo Chávez 's Venezuela -- and signed Cuba up to the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas . His supporters view him as a champion of socialism and anti-imperialism whose revolutionary regime advanced economic and social justice while securing Cuba 's independence from American imperialism . Politically a Marxist -- Leninist and Cuban nationalist , he also served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from 1961 until 2011 . Castro is a polarizing world figure .

Abroad , Castro supported anti-imperialist revolutionary groups , backing the establishment of Marxist governments in Chile , Nicaragua , and Grenada , and sending troops to aid allies in the Yom Kippur War , Ogaden War , and Angolan Civil War . Critics view him as a dictator whose administration oversaw human-rights abuses , the exodus of a large number of Cubans , and the impoverishment of the country 's economy . Adopting a Marxist -- Leninist model of development , Castro converted Cuba into a one-party , socialist state under Communist Party rule , the first in the Western Hemisphere . In 2006 he transferred his responsibilities to Vice-President Raúl Castro , who was elected to the presidency by the National Assembly in 2008 . Under his administration , Cuba became a one-party socialist state ; industry and business were nationalized , and state socialist reforms were implemented throughout society .

He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years , a period known after him as the Jacobean era , until his death in 1625 at the age of 58 .

In international affairs , Macmillan rebuilt the special relationship with the United States from the wreckage of the Suez Crisis ( of which he had been one of the architects ) , and redrew the world map by decolonising sub-Saharan Africa . Reconfiguring the nation 's defences to meet the realities of the nuclear age , he ended National Service , strengthened the nuclear forces by acquiring Polaris , and pioneered the Nuclear Test Ban with the United States and the Soviet Union . When Eden resigned in 1957 after the Suez Crisis , Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister . Belatedly recognising the dangers of strategic dependence , he sought a new role for Britain in Europe , but his unwillingness to disclose United States nuclear secrets to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom 's entry into the European Economic Community . Near the end of his premiership , his government was rocked by the Vassall and Profumo scandals , which seemed to symbolise for the rebellious youth of the 1960s the moral decay of the British establishment . Benefiting from favourable international conditions , he presided over an age of affluence , marked by low unemployment and high if uneven growth . After his resignation , Macmillan lived out a long retirement as an elder statesman . In his Bedford speech in July 1957 he told the nation they had ` never had it so good ' , but warned of the dangers of inflation , summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s . It depicted Macmillan , the British Prime Minister at the time , in the guise of the comic-book hero Superman . As a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition , haunted by memories of the Great Depression , he believed in the post-war settlement and the necessity of a mixed economy , championing a Keynesian strategy of public investment to maintain demand and pursuing corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth . The Conservatives were re-elected in 1959 with an increased majority on an electioneering budget . After losing his seat in 1929 , he regained it in 1931 , soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees , and against appeasement . It marked a third consecutive victory for the ruling Conservative Party , now led by Harold Macmillan . After the war Macmillan joined his family business , then entered Parliament in the 1924 General Election , for the northern industrial constituency of Stockton-on-Tees . Maurice Harold Macmillan , 1st Earl of Stockton , ( 10 February 1894 -- 29 December 1986 ) was a British Conservative politician and statesman who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 10 January 1957 to 19 October 1963 . Rising to high office during the Second World War as a protégé of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Macmillan then served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Churchill 's successor Sir Anthony Eden . Nicknamed `` Supermac , '' he was known for his pragmatism , wit and unflappability . Macmillan was the last British prime minister born in the reign of Queen Victoria , the last to have served in the First World War , the last to wear a moustache when in office , and the last to receive an hereditary peerage .

Thomas Woodrow Wilson ( December 28 , 1856 -- February 3 , 1924 ) was an American politician and academic who served as the 28th President of the United States from 1913 to 1921 . The War Industries Board ( WIB ) was a United States government agency established on July 28 , 1917 , during World War I , to coordinate the purchase of war supplies . Wilson won the 1912 election with a plurality of the popular vote and a large majority in the electoral college . Early in 1918 , Wilson issued his principles for an end to the war , the Fourteen Points , and in 1919 , following an armistice , he traveled to Paris , promoting the formation of a League of Nations and concluding the Treaty of Versailles . In the presidential election of 1916 , Wilson faced former New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes . He was associated with Grover Cleveland and the conservative Bourbon Democrats until 1910 , when he moved left . Having taken office one month after ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment , Wilson called a special session of Congress , whose work culminated in the Revenue Act of 1913 , introducing an income tax and lowering tariffs . In September 1918 at St. Mihiel , the First Army was directly under Pershing 's command ; it overwhelmed the salient -- the encroachment into Allied territory -- that the German Army had held for three years . A member of the Democratic Party , Wilson served as the President of Princeton University from 1902 to 1910 and as Governor of New Jersey from 1911 to 1913 . The Adamson Act was a United States federal law passed in 1916 that established an eight-hour workday , with additional pay for overtime work , for interstate railroad workers .

With the help of state Democratic bosses , Wilson won the 1910 Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey , and was elected as a fresh reformer , holding office from 1911 to 1913 . Through passage of the Adamson Act that imposed an 8-hour workday for railroads , he averted a railroad strike and an ensuing economic crisis . Wilson 's victory in the 1912 presidential election made him the first Southerner elected to the presidency since Zachary Taylor in 1848 , and Wilson became a leading force in the Progressive Movement . The United States conducted military operations alongside the Allies , although without a formal alliance . The Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 ( , codified at , ) , was a part of United States antitrust law with the goal of adding further substance to the U.S. antitrust law regime ; the Clayton Act sought to prevent anticompetitive practices in their incipiency . He won the 1912 Democratic presidential nomination after forty-six rounds of balloting , with support from William Jennings Bryan . Wilson asked Congress for what became the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 , suppressing anti-draft activists . Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Wilson maintained a policy of neutrality , while pursuing a more aggressive policy in dealing with Mexico 's civil war . He also led the United States during World War I , establishing an activist foreign policy known as `` Wilsonianism . '' During the war , Wilson focused on diplomacy and financial considerations , leaving military strategy to the generals , especially General John J. Pershing . He served as a professor and scholar at various institutions before being selected as President of Princeton University , a position he held from 1902 to 1910 . The members of the original Triple Entente of 1907 were the French Republic , the British Empire and the Russian Empire . Leading the Congress that was now in Democratic hands , he oversaw the passage of progressive legislative policies unparalleled until the New Deal in 1933 . Due to his stroke , Wilson secluded himself in the White House , disability having diminished his power and influence , and he failed in his bid to win re-nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention . The crackdown was intensified by his Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer to include expulsion of non-citizen radicals during the First Red Scare of 1919 -- 1920 . The Selective Service Act or Selective Draft Act authorized the federal government to raise a national army for the American entry into World War I through the compulsory enlistment of people .

The Scare had its origins in the hyper-nationalism of World War I as well as the Russian Revolution . After the removal of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck by Wilhelm II , the Empire embarked on a bellicose new course that ultimately led to World War I . The Armistice of 11 November 1918 was an armistice during the First World War between the Allies and Germany -- also known as the Armistice of Compiègne after the location in which it was signed -- and the agreement that ended the fighting on the Western Front . Early in 1918 , Wilson issued his principles for an end to the war , the Fourteen Points , and in 1919 , following an armistice , he traveled to Paris , promoting the formation of a League of Nations and concluding the Treaty of Versailles . The crackdown was intensified by his Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer to include expulsion of non-citizen radicals during the First Red Scare of 1919 -- 1920 . In the presidential election of 1916 , Wilson faced former New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes . The League of Nations ( abbreviated as LN in English , La Société des Nations -LSB- la sɔsjete de nɑsjɔ̃ -RSB- abbreviated as SDN or SdN in French ) was an intergovernmental organisation founded on 10 January 1920 as a result of the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First World War . The Food and Fuel Control Act , , also called the Lever Act or the Lever Food Act was a World War I era US law that among other things created the United States Food Administration and the Federal Fuel Administration . The election took place during the time of the Mexican Revolution and Europe 's involvement in World War I. Although officially neutral in the European conflict , public opinion in the United States leaned towards the Allied forces headed by Great Britain and France against the German Empire and Austria-Hungary , due in large measure to the harsh treatment of civilians by the German Army in Belgium and northern France and the militaristic character of the German and Austrian monarchies . He set up the War Industries Board , promoted labor union cooperation , regulated agriculture and food production through the Lever Act , and took direct control of the nation 's railroad system . Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Wilson maintained a policy of neutrality , while pursuing a more aggressive policy in dealing with Mexico 's civil war . He was a major leader at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 , where he championed the proposed League of Nations .

According to the rabbinic sages whose debates produced the Talmud , it was from here the world expanded into its present form and where God gathered the dust used to create the first human , Adam . Byzantine Christians , despite some signs of constructive work on the esplanade , generally neglected the Temple Mount , especially when a Jewish attempt to rebuild the Temple was destroyed by the earthquake in 363 . The Bible ( from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία , tà biblía , `` the books '' ) is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans . The Temple Mount is the holiest site in Judaism , which regards it as the place where God 's divine presence is manifested more than in any other place . The Dome of the Rock ( -LSB- قبة الصخرة , links = no -RSB- Qubbat al-Sakhrah , -LSB- כיפת הסלע , links = no -RSB- Kippat ha-Sela ) is an Islamic shrine located on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem . In the Quran , he is considered a major prophet , and Muslims generally refer to him by the Arabic variant Sulayman , son of David . The location is the holiest site in Judaism and is the place Jews turn towards during prayer . Among Sunni Muslims , the Mount is widely considered the third holiest site in Islam . According to the Bible , both Jewish Temples stood at the Temple Mount , though archaeological evidence only exists for the Second Temple . The Temple was of central importance in Jewish worship , in the Tanakh and the Christian Old Testament . Al-Aqsa Mosque ( المسجد الاقصى Al-Masjid al - ` Aqṣā , -LSB- ʔælˈmæsdʒɪd ælˈʔɑqsˤɑ -RSB- , `` the Farthest Mosque '' ) , also known as Al-Aqsa and Bayt al-Muqaddas , is the third holiest site in Sunni Islam and is located in the Old City of Jerusalem . In an attempt to keep the status quo , the Israeli government enforces a controversial ban on prayer by non-Muslims . A Muslim is someone who follows or practices Islam , a monotheistic Abrahamic religion . Umayyad Caliphs commissioned the construction of the al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock on the site . It was to this end , proof of a biblical prophecy fulfilled and of Christianity 's victory over Judaism with the New Covenant , that early Christian pilgrims also visited the site . A waqf also known as habous or mortmain property , is an inalienable charitable endowment under Islamic law , which typically involves donating a building , plot of land or other assets for Muslim religious or charitable purposes with no intention of reclaiming the assets . Jewish tradition maintains it is here a Third and final Temple will also be built . Almost immediately after the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem in 638 CE , Caliph ` Omar ibn al Khatab , disgusted by the filth covering the site , had it thoroughly cleaned , and granted Jews access to the site . Since at least the first century CE , the site has been associated in Judaism with Mount Moriah ( הַר הַמוריה , Har HaMōriyā ) ; Mount Moriah is the name given by the Hebrew Bible to the location of Abraham 's binding of Isaac , this identification being perpetuated by Jewish and Christian tradition . The Al Aqsa Mosque rests on the far southern side of the Mount , facing Mecca . The present site is dominated by three monumental structures from the early Umayyad period : the al-Aqsa Mosque , the Dome of the Rock and the Dome of the Chain , as well as four minarets . According to Jewish tradition and scripture , the First Temple was built by King Solomon the son of King David in 957 BCE and destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE . Judaism ( from Iudaismus , derived from Greek Ἰουδαϊσμός , originally from Hebrew , Yehudah , `` Judah '' ; in Hebrew : , Yahadut , the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos ) is an ancient monotheistic Abrahamic religion , with the Torah as its foundational text ( part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible ) , and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud . Several passages in the Hebrew Bible indicate that during the time when they were written , the Temple Mount was identified as Mount Zion . After the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE , which came to be regarded by early Christians , as it was by Josephus and the sages of the Jerusalem Talmud , to be a divine act of punishment for the sins of the Jewish people , the Temple Mount lost its significance for Christian worship with the Christians considering it a fulfillment of Christ 's prophecy at , for example , and . oggˈkɹɪʃtʃən -RSB- or -LSB- ˈkɹɪstjən -RSB- ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity , an Abrahamic , monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ . الإسلام , -LSB- alʔisˈlaːm -RSB- ) is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion which professes that there is only one and incomparable God ( Allah ) and that Muhammad is the last messenger of God . The Temple in Jerusalem or Holy Temple ( , Modern : Beit HaMikdash , Tiberian : Beiṯ HamMiqdāš , Ashkenazi : Beis HaMikdosh ; ቤተ መቅደስ : Betä Mäqdäs ) was any of a series of structures which were located on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem , the current site of the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque . It has been venerated as a holy site for thousands of years by Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . Since the Crusades , the Muslim community of Jerusalem has managed the site as a Waqf , without interruption . According to the Bible the site should function as the center of all national life -- a governmental , judicial and religious center . Hebrew Bible or Hebrew Scriptures ( Biblia Hebraica ) is the term used by biblical scholars to refer to the Tanakh ( תנ '' ך Thanach ) , the canonical collection of Jewish texts , which is the common textual source of several canonical editions of the Christian Old Testament . Revered as the Noble Sanctuary , the location of Muhammad 's journey to Jerusalem and ascent to heaven , the site is also associated with Jewish biblical prophets who are also venerated in Islam . Due to its extreme sanctity , many Jews will not walk on the Mount itself , to avoid unintentionally entering the area where the Holy of Holies stood , since according to Rabbinical law , some aspect of the divine presence is still present at the site . In light of the dual claims of both Judaism and Islam , it is one of the most contested religious sites in the world . However , the identification of Solomon 's Temple with the area of the Temple Mount is widespread . In the New Testament it remains the site of several events in the life of Jesus , and Christian loyalty to it as a focal point remained long after his death . The New Testament or NT ( Ἡ Καινὴ , Hē Kainḕ Diathḗkē ; Novum Testamentum ) is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon , the first part being the Old Testament , based on the Hebrew Bible . The Talmud ( -LSB- ˈtɑ : lmʊd ,   - məd ,   ˈtæl - -RSB- Hebrew : talmūd `` instruction , learning '' , from a root -LSB- : wikt : למד , LMD -RSB- `` teach , study '' ) is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism . is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ , who serves as the focal point for the religion .

Refusing to accept his government 's armistice with Nazi Germany , de Gaulle exhorted the French population to resist occupation and to continue the fight in his Appeal of 18 June . De Gaulle resigned in 1969 after losing a referendum in which he proposed more decentralization . De Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic with a strong presidency , and he was elected in that role . Gaullism ( Gaullisme ) is a French political stance based on the thought and action of World War II French Resistance leader General Charles de Gaulle , who would become the founding President of the Fifth French Republic . He was the leader of Free France ( 1940 -- 44 ) and the head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic ( 1944 -- 46 ) . The Fifth Republic , led by Charles de Gaulle , was formed in 1958 and remains to this day . When the Algerian War was ripping apart the unstable Fourth Republic , the National Assembly brought him back to power during the May 1958 crisis . Wartime leader Charles de Gaulle returned from retirement to preside over a transitional administration which was empowered to design a new French constitution . During the German invasion of May 1940 , he led an armoured division which counterattacked the invaders ; he was then appointed Under-Secretary for War . Charles André Joseph Marie de Gaulle ( -LSB- ʃaʁl də ɡol -RSB- ; 22 November 1890 -- 9 November 1970 ) was a French general and statesman . Although re-elected President in 1965 , in May 1968 he appeared likely to lose power amid widespread protests by students and workers but survived the crisis with backing from the Army and won an election with an increased majority in the Assembly . Effectively started by members of the National Liberation Front ( FLN ) on November 1 , 1954 , during the Toussaint Rouge ( `` Red All Saints ' Day '' ) , the conflict shook the foundations of the weak and unstable Fourth French Republic ( 1946 -- 58 ) and led to its replacement by the Fifth Republic with a strengthened Presidency and with Charles de Gaulle as President . He restored cordial Franco-German relations to create a European counterweight between the Anglo-American and Soviet spheres of influence . He became Head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic in June 1944 , the interim government of France following its Liberation . He was the dominant figure of France during the Cold War era and his memory continues to influence French politics . To this end , de Gaulle pursued a policy of `` national independence '' which led him to withdraw from NATO 's military integrated command and to launch an independent nuclear development program that made France the fourth nuclear power . Despite frosty relations with Britain and especially the United States , he emerged as the undisputed leader of the French resistance . The Appeal of 18 June ( L'Appel du 18 juin ) was a famous speech by Charles de Gaulle , the leader of the Free French Forces , in 1940 . It was rejected by 52.4 % of voters , and failure of the amendments led to President Charles de Gaulle 's resignation . Many French political parties and figures claim the Gaullist legacy . In his later years , his support for an independent Quebec and his two vetoes against Britain 's entry into the European Community generated considerable controversy . Frustrated by the return of petty partisanship in the new Fourth Republic , he resigned in early 1946 but continued to be politically active as founder of the RPF party . He led a government in exile and the Free French Forces against the Axis . Even though France has at times been eurosceptical in outlook , especially under President Charles de Gaulle , Franco-German agreements and cooperations have always been key to furthering the ideals of European integration . In 1958 , he founded the Fifth Republic and was elected as the President of France , a position he held until his resignation in 1969 . He managed to keep France together while taking steps to end the war , much to the anger of the Pieds-Noirs ( Frenchmen settled in Algeria ) and the military ; both previously had supported his return to power to maintain colonial rule . was a controversial phrase in a speech delivered by President Charles de Gaulle of France on July 24 , 1967 , during an official visit to Canada under the pretext of attending Expo 67 in Montreal , Quebec . In the context of the Cold War , de Gaulle initiated his `` Politics of Grandeur '' , asserting that France as a major power should not rely on other countries , such as the US , for its national security and prosperity .

According to the rabbinic sages whose debates produced the Talmud , it was from here the world expanded into its present form and where God gathered the dust used to create the first human , Adam . The Temple Mount is the holiest site in Judaism , which regards it as the place where God 's divine presence is manifested more than in any other place . The location is the holiest site in Judaism and is the place Jews turn towards during prayer . Among Sunni Muslims , the Mount is widely considered the third holiest site in Islam . Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam , Abraham , Moses , and Jesus . It was to this end , proof of a biblical prophecy fulfilled and of Christianity 's victory over Judaism with the New Covenant , that early Christian pilgrims also visited the site . According to the creation myth of the Abrahamic religions , he was the first human . It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism , Christianity and Islam . Almost immediately after the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem in 638 CE , Caliph ` Omar ibn al Khatab , disgusted by the filth covering the site , had it thoroughly cleaned , and granted Jews access to the site . Since at least the first century CE , the site has been associated in Judaism with Mount Moriah ( הַר הַמוריה , Har HaMōriyā ) ; Mount Moriah is the name given by the Hebrew Bible to the location of Abraham 's binding of Isaac , this identification being perpetuated by Jewish and Christian tradition . Christianity is an Abrahamic religion that began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the mid-1st century . The present site is dominated by three monumental structures from the early Umayyad period : the al-Aqsa Mosque , the Dome of the Rock and the Dome of the Chain , as well as four minarets . Judaism ( from Iudaismus , derived from Greek Ἰουδαϊσμός , originally from Hebrew , Yehudah , `` Judah '' ; in Hebrew : , Yahadut , the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos ) is an ancient monotheistic Abrahamic religion , with the Torah as its foundational text ( part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible ) , and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud . Muslims preferred to the esplanade as the heart for the Muslim quarter since it had been abandoned by Christians , to avoid disturbing the Christian quarters of Jerusalem . After the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE , which came to be regarded by early Christians , as it was by Josephus and the sages of the Jerusalem Talmud , to be a divine act of punishment for the sins of the Jewish people , the Temple Mount lost its significance for Christian worship with the Christians considering it a fulfillment of Christ 's prophecy at , for example , and . الإسلام , -LSB- alʔisˈlaːm -RSB- ) is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion which professes that there is only one and incomparable God ( Allah ) and that Muhammad is the last messenger of God . Muhammad had stated explicitly during his lifetime that Abrahamic religious groups ( still a majority in times of the Umayyad Caliphate ) , should be allowed to practice their own religion , provided that they paid the jizya taxation . It has been venerated as a holy site for thousands of years by Judaism , Christianity , and Islam . Since the Crusades , the Muslim community of Jerusalem has managed the site as a Waqf , without interruption . Revered as the Noble Sanctuary , the location of Muhammad 's journey to Jerusalem and ascent to heaven , the site is also associated with Jewish biblical prophets who are also venerated in Islam . Judaism 's texts , traditions and values strongly influenced later Abrahamic religions , including Christianity , Islam and the Baha'i Faith . Islam also views itself as superseding the Christian faith with its doctrine of Tahrif , which `` sees itself as the final successor to and the completion of the Abrahamic faith tradition of ethical and prophetic monotheism . '' Like other Abrahamic religions , Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded paradise and unrighteous are punished in hell . and it became a desolate local rubbish dump , perhaps outside the city limits , as Christian worship in Jerusalem shifted to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre , and Jerusalem 's centrality was replaced by Rome . The Temple Mount ( הַר הַבַּיִת , Har HaBáyit , `` Mount of the House -LSB- of God , i.e. the Temple -RSB- '' ) , known to Muslims as the Haram esh-Sharif ( الحرم الشريف , al-Ḥaram al-Šarīf , `` the Noble Sanctuary '' , or الحرم القدسي الشريف , al-Ḥaram al-Qudsī al-Šarīf , `` the Noble Sanctuary of Jerusalem '' ) , a hill located in the Old City of Jerusalem , is one of the most important religious sites in the world . In light of the dual claims of both Judaism and Islam , it is one of the most contested religious sites in the world . is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ , who serves as the focal point for the religion . The name later migrated for a last time , this time to Jerusalem 's Western Hill .

Thomas Woodrow Wilson ( December 28 , 1856 -- February 3 , 1924 ) was an American politician and academic who served as the 28th President of the United States from 1913 to 1921 . Born in Staunton , Virginia , he spent his early years in Augusta , Georgia and Columbia , South Carolina . Wilson won the 1912 election with a plurality of the popular vote and a large majority in the electoral college . Early in 1918 , Wilson issued his principles for an end to the war , the Fourteen Points , and in 1919 , following an armistice , he traveled to Paris , promoting the formation of a League of Nations and concluding the Treaty of Versailles . In the presidential election of 1916 , Wilson faced former New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes . On the home front , he raised income taxes , borrowing billions of dollars through the public 's purchase of Liberty Bonds . He was associated with Grover Cleveland and the conservative Bourbon Democrats until 1910 , when he moved left . Having taken office one month after ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment , Wilson called a special session of Congress , whose work culminated in the Revenue Act of 1913 , introducing an income tax and lowering tariffs . A member of the Democratic Party , Wilson served as the President of Princeton University from 1902 to 1910 and as Governor of New Jersey from 1911 to 1913 . In April 1917 , when Germany had resumed unrestricted submarine warfare and sent the Zimmermann Telegram , Wilson asked Congress to declare war in order to make `` the world safe for democracy . '' His father was a leading Presbyterian in the Confederacy during the Civil War , and Wilson was always a devout Presbyterian and a proud Southerner . Following his return from Europe , Wilson embarked on a nationwide tour in 1919 to campaign for the treaty , but suffered a severe stroke . By a narrow margin , he became the first Democrat since Andrew Jackson elected to two consecutive terms . He suffered debilitating strokes in September 1919 ; after that his wife and staff handled most of his presidential duties . He overthrew the same bosses and gained a national reputation . He set up the War Industries Board , promoted labor union cooperation , regulated agriculture and food production through the Lever Act , and took direct control of the nation 's railroad system . With the help of state Democratic bosses , Wilson won the 1910 Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey , and was elected as a fresh reformer , holding office from 1911 to 1913 . Through passage of the Adamson Act that imposed an 8-hour workday for railroads , he averted a railroad strike and an ensuing economic crisis . Wilson 's victory in the 1912 presidential election made him the first Southerner elected to the presidency since Zachary Taylor in 1848 , and Wilson became a leading force in the Progressive Movement . He took a law degree and then one of the first PhDs in political science awarded by Johns Hopkins University . He won the 1912 Democratic presidential nomination after forty-six rounds of balloting , with support from William Jennings Bryan . Wilson asked Congress for what became the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 , suppressing anti-draft activists . Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Wilson maintained a policy of neutrality , while pursuing a more aggressive policy in dealing with Mexico 's civil war . He also led the United States during World War I , establishing an activist foreign policy known as `` Wilsonianism . '' During the war , Wilson focused on diplomacy and financial considerations , leaving military strategy to the generals , especially General John J. Pershing . He served as a professor and scholar at various institutions before being selected as President of Princeton University , a position he held from 1902 to 1910 . Leading the Congress that was now in Democratic hands , he oversaw the passage of progressive legislative policies unparalleled until the New Deal in 1933 . Due to his stroke , Wilson secluded himself in the White House , disability having diminished his power and influence , and he failed in his bid to win re-nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention . Wilson staffed his government with Southern Democrats who implemented racial segregation at the Treasury , Navy and other Federal offices . He was a major leader at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 , where he championed the proposed League of Nations .

In the words of historian Henry Steele Commager , `` In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects , the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat . '' An accomplished diplomat , he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco-American relations . Franklin was a renowned polymath and a leading author , printer , political theorist , politician , freemason , postmaster , scientist , inventor , civic activist , statesman , and diplomat . During the Revolution , he became the first US Postmaster General . He facilitated many civic organizations , including Philadelphia 's fire department and the University of Pennsylvania , an Ivy League institution . He initially owned and dealt in slaves but , by the 1750s , he argued against slavery from an economic perspective and became one of the most prominent abolitionists . Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical values of thrift , hard work , education , community spirit , self-governing institutions , and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious , with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment . Benjamin Franklin FRS , FRSE ( April 17 , 1790 ) was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States . He was promoted to deputy postmaster-general for the British colonies in 1753 , having been Philadelphia postmaster for many years , and this enabled him to set up the first national communications network . The Founding Fathers of the United States are those individuals of the Thirteen Colonies in North America who led the American Revolution against the authority of the British Crown in word and deed and contributed to the establishment of the United States of America . Franklin became a national hero in America as an agent for several colonies when he spearheaded an effort in London to have the Parliament of Great Britain repeal the unpopular Stamp Act . Franklin earned the title of `` The First American '' for his early and indefatigable campaigning for colonial unity , initially as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies . As the first United States Ambassador to France , he exemplified the emerging American nation . As an inventor , he is known for the lightning rod , bifocals , and the Franklin stove , among other inventions . From 1785 to 1788 , he served as governor of Pennsylvania . He organized and was the first secretary of the American Philosophical Society and was elected president in 1769 . He became wealthy publishing this and Poor Richard 's Almanack , which he authored under the pseudonym `` Richard Saunders '' . After 1767 , he was associated with the Pennsylvania Chronicle , a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of the British policies . To Walter Isaacson , this makes Franklin `` the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become . '' As a scientist , he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity . He was active in community affairs and colonial and state politics , as well as national and international affairs . His efforts proved vital for the American Revolution in securing shipments of crucial munitions from France . His colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement , and his status as one of America 's most influential Founding Fathers have seen Franklin honored more than two centuries after his death on coinage and the $ 100 bill , warships , and the names of many towns , counties , educational institutions , and corporations , as well as countless cultural references . Franklin became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia , the leading city in the colonies , publishing the Pennsylvania Gazette at the age of 23 . He pioneered and was first president of The Academy and College of Philadelphia which opened in 1751 and later became the University of Pennsylvania .

Through the Selective Service Act , conscription sent 10,000 freshly trained soldiers to France per day by the summer of 1918 . Wilson retired at the end of his presidency , and he died in 1924 . Thomas Woodrow Wilson ( December 28 , 1856 -- February 3 , 1924 ) was an American politician and academic who served as the 28th President of the United States from 1913 to 1921 . The War Industries Board ( WIB ) was a United States government agency established on July 28 , 1917 , during World War I , to coordinate the purchase of war supplies . Wilson won the 1912 election with a plurality of the popular vote and a large majority in the electoral college . Early in 1918 , Wilson issued his principles for an end to the war , the Fourteen Points , and in 1919 , following an armistice , he traveled to Paris , promoting the formation of a League of Nations and concluding the Treaty of Versailles . In the presidential election of 1916 , Wilson faced former New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes . It was envisioned in December 1916 and brought to President Woodrow Wilson 's attention shortly after the break in relations with Germany in February 1917 . He was associated with Grover Cleveland and the conservative Bourbon Democrats until 1910 , when he moved left . Having taken office one month after ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment , Wilson called a special session of Congress , whose work culminated in the Revenue Act of 1913 , introducing an income tax and lowering tariffs . A member of the Democratic Party , Wilson served as the President of Princeton University from 1902 to 1910 and as Governor of New Jersey from 1911 to 1913 . The Adamson Act was a United States federal law passed in 1916 that established an eight-hour workday , with additional pay for overtime work , for interstate railroad workers . In April 1917 , when Germany had resumed unrestricted submarine warfare and sent the Zimmermann Telegram , Wilson asked Congress to declare war in order to make `` the world safe for democracy . '' Following his return from Europe , Wilson embarked on a nationwide tour in 1919 to campaign for the treaty , but suffered a severe stroke . World War I ( WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War , the Great War , or the War to End All Wars , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . He suffered debilitating strokes in September 1919 ; after that his wife and staff handled most of his presidential duties . He set up the War Industries Board , promoted labor union cooperation , regulated agriculture and food production through the Lever Act , and took direct control of the nation 's railroad system . With the help of state Democratic bosses , Wilson won the 1910 Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey , and was elected as a fresh reformer , holding office from 1911 to 1913 . Through passage of the Adamson Act that imposed an 8-hour workday for railroads , he averted a railroad strike and an ensuing economic crisis . Wilson 's victory in the 1912 presidential election made him the first Southerner elected to the presidency since Zachary Taylor in 1848 , and Wilson became a leading force in the Progressive Movement . He won the 1912 Democratic presidential nomination after forty-six rounds of balloting , with support from William Jennings Bryan . Wilson asked Congress for what became the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 , suppressing anti-draft activists . Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Wilson maintained a policy of neutrality , while pursuing a more aggressive policy in dealing with Mexico 's civil war . He also led the United States during World War I , establishing an activist foreign policy known as `` Wilsonianism . '' He served as a professor and scholar at various institutions before being selected as President of Princeton University , a position he held from 1902 to 1910 . Leading the Congress that was now in Democratic hands , he oversaw the passage of progressive legislative policies unparalleled until the New Deal in 1933 . Due to his stroke , Wilson secluded himself in the White House , disability having diminished his power and influence , and he failed in his bid to win re-nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention . The crackdown was intensified by his Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer to include expulsion of non-citizen radicals during the First Red Scare of 1919 -- 1920 . He was a major leader at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 , where he championed the proposed League of Nations .
