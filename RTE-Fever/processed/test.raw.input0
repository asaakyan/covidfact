While each surrogate virus exhibited subtle differences in the sensitivity with which neutralizing activity was detected, the neutralizing activity of both convalescent plasma and human monoclonal antibodies measured using each virus correlated quantitatively with neutralizing activity measured using an authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. Here, we describe a collection of approaches based on SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped, single-cycle, replication-defective human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), as well as a replication-competent VSV/SARS- CoV-2 chimeric virus.

Crown- forming protein A contains all viral activities for RNA synthesis and shares distant sequence similarities to alphavirus RNA replication proteins ( 11 13). A crown-like pore complex on coronavirus RCs ( 5) parallels a similar crown of viral proteins on nodavirus RCs ( 12), providing a channel to release RNA progeny to the cytoplasm.

The study provides preventive measures related to air pollution to limit future outbreaks of morbidity and mortality due to the coronavirus. Epidemiologists widely agree that there is a correlation between acute and locally elevated concentrations of fine particles and the severity of influenza waves. The increase in fine particles is generally favored by air temperature inversions, characterized by fog situations, or by Saharan dust intrusions. A multifactorial pandemic Nonetheless, the researchers also emphasize that, although particulate matter pollution can influence the virulence of the virus and possible severe disease progression, physiological, social or economic factors will clearly also influence the further course of the pandemic.

Overall, our study highlights GNS561 as a powerful drug in SARS- CoV-2 infection and supports that the hypothesis that autophagy inhibitors could be an alternative strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data indicated that GNS561 showed the highest antiviral effect for two SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to CQ and remdesivir. Finally, our study revealed that the combination of GNS561 and remdesivir was associated with a strong synergistic antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity and associated mechanism of GNS561, a small basic lipophilic molecule inhibitor of late-stage autophagy, against SARS-CoV-2.

Severe allergy-like reactions in at least eight people who received the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech over the past 2 weeks may be due to a compound in the packaging of the messenger RNA (mRNA) that forms the vaccines main ingredient, scientists say. Patients with severe allergies in the US are getting nervous about the possibility that they may not be able to get vaccinated, at least with those two vaccines, Togias wrote in an invitation to meeting participants. Some allergists and immunologists believe a small number of people previously exposed to PEG may have high levels of antibodies against PEG, putting them at risk of an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine. NIAID is also setting up a study in collaboration with FDA to analyze the response to the vaccine in people who have high levels of anti-PEG antibodies or have experienced severe allergic responses to drugs or vaccines before.

Berberine, a plant-derived alkaloid, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations and obatoclax, originally developed as an anti-apoptotic protein antagonist, was effective at sub-micromolar concentrations. In this study, we demonstrate that berberine and obatoclax, two broad-spectrum antiviral compounds, are effective against multiple isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, both obatoclax and berberine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in these primary target cells. Berberine and obatoclax inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human nasal epithelial c

Low 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels on Admission to the Intensive Care Unit May Predispose COVID-19 Pneumonia Patients to a Higher 28-Day Mortality Risk: A Pilot Study on a Greek ICU Cohort. In this cohort, significantly lower 25(OH)D levels ( p = 0.004) were found in PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median value 11.1 ng/mL) patients compared with negative patients (24.6 ng/mL); this was also confirmed by stratifying patients according to age >70 years. Many authors have suggested the involvement of vitamin D in reducing the risk of infections; thus, we retrospectively investigated the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in plasma obtained from a cohort of patients from Switzerland.

Photo: Ulf Sirborn Our results indicate that public immunity to COVID-19 is probably significantly higher than antibody tests have suggested, says Professor Hans- Gustaf Ljunggren at the Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, and co-senior author. One interesting observation was that it wasnt just individuals with verified COVID-19 who showed T-cell immunity but also many of their exposed asymptomatic family members, says Soo Aleman. Our results indicate that roughly twice as many people have developed T-cell immunity compared with those who we can detect antibodies in. In the present study, the researchers performed immunological analyses of samples from over 200 people, many of whom had mild or no symptoms of COVID-19.

To replace microscopic counting-based SARS-CoV-2 PRNTs by a novel assay exempt from genetically modified viruses, which are inapplicable in most diagnostics departments, we established a simple, rapid, and automated SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay employing an in- cell ELISA (icELISA) approach. A novel in-cell ELISA assay allows rapid and automated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 to analyse neutralizing antibodies and antiviral compounds. Altogether, the SARS-CoV-2 icELISA test allows rapid (<48 h in total, read-out in seconds) and automated quantification of virus infection in cell culture to evaluate the efficacy of NAbs and antiviral drugs using reagents and equipment present in most routine diagnostics departments.

The use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission. One of the most well-known attempts to justify sending workers back to offices and factories based on a supposed antibody count comes from the controversial Santa Clara study, as it has come to be known. The Stanford researchers acknowledged as much in the study and used test performance weights to scale results, but Rutherford was skeptical of these weights, as well as the population weights the researchers used. In a peer review of the antibody study published to Medium, former Stanford lecturer Balaji Srinivasan, who specializes in statistics and computational biology, argued the selection methods could have overstated the prevalence of the disease in the county. Dr. Natalie E. Dean, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, tweeted that she had concerns with the adjustments made for clustering (some participants brought children and other household members with them to the test) and test characteristics (researchers assume no false positives but some false negatives).

The Stanford researchers acknowledged as much in the study and used test performance weights to scale results, but Rutherford was skeptical of these weights, as well as the population weights the researchers used. In a peer review of the antibody study published to Medium, former Stanford lecturer Balaji Srinivasan, who specializes in statistics and computational biology, argued the selection methods could have overstated the prevalence of the disease in the county. Dr. Natalie E. Dean, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, tweeted that she had concerns with the adjustments made for clustering (some participants brought children and other household members with them to the test) and test characteristics (researchers assume no false positives but some false negatives).

However, for the other 39 (two thirds) of the contacts, index cases were unable or unwilling to give their names and details. The BMJ A covid-19 contact tracing pilot scheme in Sheffield has found that two thirds of people contacted did not fully cooperate, and many of those worked in health and care settings. The Sheffield Community Contact Tracers team was created by a group of retired doctors and public health experts and began the local pilot in April after they became frustrated by the lack of government action on contact tracing.1 In a report,2 the team described the inability or unwillingness to engage by people working in health and care settings as a major challenge. They said that contact tracing may be resisted in workplaces, especially in the NHS and care homes, where contact tracing systems, social distancing of staff, and a culture supportive of self-isolation frequently does not exist. They also found that one in five of the initial patients responded to phone calls only after a physical message was hand deliveredsomething that the UK government may want to consider as it launches new NHS test and trace services.

Within this library, ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed human coronavirus replication in cultured cells, but did not suppress replication of respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus. After the eleventh consecutive MERS-CoV passage in the presence of ciclesonide, a resistant mutation was generated, which resulted in an amino acid substitution (A25V) in nonstructural protein (NSP) 15, as identified using reverse genetics. These observations suggest that the effect of ciclesonide was specific to coronavirus, suggesting this is a candidate drug for treatment of patients suffering MERS or COVID-19.

The candidate peptides were designed by applying to viral antigens a technology used for personalized vaccination in cancer, based on long neoantigen peptides, currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy. Technical details of the approach used are detailed below: We identified multiepitope peptide vaccine candidates against nCov that can potentially trigger both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune response. The approach that we used for designing potential peptide vaccine candidates takes a more personalized strategy, referred to as vaccinomics , which enables the selection of target viral proteins with low mutation rates, and the design of peptides tuned to the immune characteristics of the target populations, variable based on geographic location and ethnicity. Based on the human MHC (human leukocyte antigen) allele variation, the peptide vaccines can be made more relevant to a community or individual. The selection of the peptides that could act as vaccines is determined by the binding of the processed viral peptide with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules, and the relevant HLA alleles.

New AI model detects asymptomatic Covid-19 infections through device-recorded coughs Vocal sentiments Prior to the pandemics onset, research groups already had been training algorithms on cellphone recordings of coughs to accurately diagnose conditions such as pneumonia and asthma. The model identified 98.5 percent of coughs from people confirmed with Covid-19, and of those, it accurately detected all of the asymptomatic coughs. When they fed the model new cough recordings, it accurately identified 98.5 percent of coughs from people who were confirmed to have Covid-19, including 100 percent of coughs from asymptomatics  who reported they did not have symptoms but had tested positive for the virus.

Of those, a total of 91 specimens from 90 people showed false positive results. The department said the state public health laboratory uncovered a flaw in one of the testing systems it uses to test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and 90 of 144 people tested between June 15 and July 17 received a false positive COVID test report. Accurate and timely testing for the novel coronavirus is one of the pillars supporting effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic. She said adjustments have already been made to ensure the accuracy of future test results from this platform. They said all positive results will be further analyzed by multiple laboratory scientists, and if indicated, retested using another method. The lab used another FDA-authorized test and found the false positives. Any nursing home resident who received a false positive COVID-19 test result will be retested as soon as possible, according to the Department of Health.

Here, we correlated protein-level mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus to clinical outcome. Conclusions We demonstrate that mutations in the viral genes may have a direct correlation to clinical outcome. Mutations correlated to mild outcome were located in the ORF8, NSP6, ORF3a, NSP4, and in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N. Mutations associated with inferior outcome were located in the surface (S) glycoprotein, in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, in the 3-to5 exonuclease, in ORF3a, NSP2 and N. Mutations leading to severe outcome with low prevalence were found in the surface (S) glycoprotein and in NSP7. Our results help to quickly identify SARS-CoV-2 infections harboring mutations related to severe outcome.

These antibodies were not associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections or hospitalizations, but paradoxically these hCoV cross-reactive antibodies were boosted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We then quantified pre-pandemic antibody levels in serum from a separate cohort of 252 individuals who became PCR-confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, most humans had been previously exposed to other antigenically distinct common seasonal human coronaviruses (hCoVs) before the COVID-19 pandemic.

These findings provide compelling evidence that the disruption of type I interferon is often the cause of life-threatening COVID-19, says Jean-Laurent Casanova, head of the St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases at The Rockefeller University and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. COVID-19 may now be the best understood acute infectious disease in terms of having a molecular and genetic explanation for nearly 15 percent of critical cases across diverse ancestries, Casanova says. Genetics of COVID-19 outliers The way SARS-CoV-2 affects people differently has been puzzling. Science Inborn errors of type I IFN immunity in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 Zhang Q. et al. Whether the proteins have been neutralized by so-called auto- antibodies, or were not produced in sufficient amounts in the first place due to a faulty gene, their missing-in-action appears to be a common theme among a subgroup of COVID-19 sufferers whose disease has thus far been a mystery.

"In a recent study, researchers found that UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can quickly and effectively kill the human coronavirus HCoV-OC43. A new study suggests the novel coronavirus can be killed cheaply and efficiently by ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs). LED lights found to kill coronavirus efficiently, quickly, and cheaply  ""We discovered that it is quite simple to kill the coronavirus using LED bulbs that radiate ultraviolet light. In the study, the researchers found a range of wavelengths at which UV-LEDs effectively kill coronaviruses."

As a whole, details contained in the results reported in this weeks paper may help to explain the efficiency of the new coronavirus in delivering its viral code into human cells, and its rapid transmission among people. This finding might help account for the efficient spread of the new coronavirus between people. The spikes crowning the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 atypical pneumonia are divulging how they attach, fuse and gain entry to cells.

Pharmacological PLP supplementation may therefore mitigate COVID-19 symptoms by alleviating both the immune suppression underlying viral spread and the pathological hypersecretion of inflammatory cytokines, as well as directly bolstering endothelial integrity and preventing hypercoagulability. In inflammatory disease, pharmacological doses of PLP decrease circulating TNFα, IL-6 and D-dimer, and animal studies demonstrate that supplemental PLP shortens the duration and severity of viral pneumonia.

SARS-CoV-2 transmission is defined by a narrow bottleneck. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in cats involved a narrow bottleneck, with new infections founded by fewer than ten viruses. While estimates of the size of the SARS- CoV-2 transmission bottleneck remain highly discordant in humans, we find very narrow transmission bottlenecks in cats, involving transmission of only 2-5 viruses.

Seventy percent of US states had an actual death rate outside the 95 percent prediction interval for that state, casting doubt on whether the model is suitable to inform COVID-19 resource allocation. Credit: Pixabay An international group of renowned statisticians from the University of Sydney, Northwestern University and the University of Texas have collaborated to fully investigate the predictive performance of the COVID-19 model developed by Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)  which provides forecasts for ventilator use and hospital beds in the United States. I am concerned that if the UW-IHME model has had difficulty in predicting the next day, how will the predictions fair over the long term, said Professor Tanner. Published on pre-publication server arXiv, the researchers found that the IHME model substantially underestimates the uncertainty associated with COVID-19 deaths.

Confusion over how China is counting cases of infections is making it harder to know how coronavirus is spreading, even as China is officially reporting that the numbers of new cases reported in recent days have fallen sharply. ""Its not unusual to count things in different ways as the epidemic evolves, said Sylvie Briand, WHO director of the infectious hazards management department."" Asked by reporters about the potential impact of the coronavirus on the economy and whether he anticipates it being similar to the effect of SARS, Kudlow said, I understand the risks, and I understand these things could change quickly, but right now what we know is theres barely any impact here at home. ""The human toll in my opinion is more important than the statistics [Chinas] getting hurt very badly, he added. """

Mayor Martin J. Walsh, together with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC), today announced the study to evaluate community exposure to COVID-19 through a representative sampling of asymptomatic Boston residents resulted in 9.9% testing positive for antibodies and 2.6% of currently asymptomatic individuals testing positive for COVID-19. In conclusion, approximately 1 in 10 residents in this study have developed antibodies and approximately 1 in 40 currently asymptomatic individuals are positive for COVID-19 and potentially infectious.

Wearing a face covering can help to reduce the chance that those who may not know they are sick will spread the infection to others. Perhaps it would also be rational to recommend that people in quarantine wear face masks if they need to leave home for any reason, to prevent potential asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission.

Tables show the immune parameters that have been reported to differ between mild and severe COVID-19. (Express Photo: Amit Chakravarty) A new study suggests that the differing immune system responses of Covid-19 patients can help predict who will experience moderate and severe consequences of disease. The findings may help identify individuals at high risk of severe illness early in their hospitalization and suggest drugs to treat COVID-19. More carefully defining distinct classes of T cell response types in COVID-19 and delineating how pre-existing conditions, co-morbidities, race, immune health status and other variables influence T cell responses should reveal novel opportunities for treatment and prevention.

Following the necessary approvals from regulators, as well as the national ministry of health, and Kilifi county, the first volunteers for the trial have recently received their vaccinations. The trial in Kenya will initially involve 40 frontline workers in Kilifi County. Professor Andy Pollard, Director of the Oxford Vaccine Group and Chief Investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial, said: Were excited to see our colleagues in Kenya today joining those around the world in helping us to evaluate the ChAdOx1 nCov-2019 Oxford coronavirus vaccine, as it is important to evaluate the vaccine in as many different populations as possible. Kenya joins a number of countries including the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil who are running trials to evaluate the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, with over 20,000 volunteers now taking part in trials across these countries.

Model predictions fail because the observed infection rates are beyond modeling: any model that uses fixed rates or uses memory or averages of past rates cannot reproduce the data on active infections. SUMMARYREFERENCES The pandemic infection rates to two to three decimal places are an example of complexity: the infection rates can be calculated daily from the infections but they cannot be modeled and predicted from fixed initial conditions. Second, model building does not and cannot reflect real epidemic data because the only correct rates emerge day by day in the daily data, cannot be usefully forecast for more than a few days in advance, and cannot be forecast at all correctly near a peak.

"England's Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said current coronavirus swab tests would detect the new variant that has been found predominantly in Kent and neighbouring areas in recent weeks. The early landscape of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine development in the UK and rest of the world. It is thought the variant either emerged in a patient in the UK or has been imported from a country with a lower ability to monitor coronavirus mutations. A number of variants have already been detected in the UK. Matt Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus ""may be associated"" with the faster spread in the south-east of England."

The coronavirus has mutated and May52020 COVID19 KEY POINTS: The coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, has mutated and the new, dominant strain spreading across the U.S. appears to be even more contagious, according to a new study. If the coronavirus doesnt subside in the summer like the seasonal flu, it could mutate further and potentially limit the effectiveness of the coronavirus vaccines being developed by scientists around the world, the researchers warned. The coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, over four months ago has since mutated and the new, dominant strain spreading across the U.S. appears to be even more contagious, according to a new study.

We followed the emerging concerns about use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19, and took into consideration the results from two different trials, including the UKs RECOVERY trial which has provided convincing evidence of no meaningful mortality benefit in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. The MHRA took into consideration the results released from the RECOVERY trial, showing no beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and a New England Journal of Medicine publication using hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis of COVID-19, concluding that hydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness compatible with Covid-19 or confirmed infection.

Specialized chemosensory epithelial cells that express the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 (TRPM5) are found throughout the airways and intestinal epithelium and are involved in responses to viral infection. Our study provides new insights into a potential role for TRPM5-expressing cells in viral infection of the olfactory epithelium. We find profuse expression of transcripts involved in inflammation, immunity and viral infection in TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells and olfactory sensory neurons.

In conclusion, therapeutic aprotinin concentrations exert anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Herein, we showed that the protease inhibitor aprotinin (but not the protease inhibitor SERPINA1/alpha-1 antitrypsin) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in therapeutically achievable concentrations. Aprotinin displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in different cell types (Caco2, Calu-3, and primary bronchial epithelial cell air-liquid interface cultures) and against four virus isolates.

Trials need to be EXPEDITED. It seems he got his wish: Today, New Jersey-based Celularity said it has been given the all-clear from the FDA to start its clinical trial of CYNK-001, its allogeneic, off-the-shelf, cryopreserved natural killer cell therapy to be used in a phase 1/2 study in up to 86 patients with COVID-19.

The scientists found that patients with severe COVID-19 displayed many of these hallmarks of extrafollicular B cell responses associated with lupus. The critically-ill COVID-19 patients who survived and recovered from the infection also showed lingering symptoms similar to those experienced by lupus patients during acute flare-ups.

As illustrated in the COVID-19 study, while public health officials must work quickly to understand how a new virus functions, without appropriate testing or coordinated response strategies the risk grows for infections to go unreported. The study provides insight into how limited testing and gaps in surveillance during the initial phase of the epidemic resulted in so many cases going undetected. The potential for misdiagnosis and the limitations of surveillance are huge issues across infectious diseases, especially emerging infectious diseases, he added.

Ivermectin may be effective for the treatment of early-onset mild COVID-19 in adult patients. Ivermectin to prevent hospitalizations in patients with COVID-19 (IVERCOR-COVID19): a structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. A 5-day course of ivermectin was found to be safe and effective in treating adult patients with mild COVID-19. A 5-day course of ivermectin resulted in an earlier clearance of the virus compared to placebo ( p = 0.005), thus indicating that early intervention with this agent may limit viral replication within the host.

These observations led us to hypothesize that Brd4-bound enhancers might underlie sex differences in stem cell function and tumorigenicity in GBM. We report that sex-biased Brd4 activity drive sex differences in GBM and render male and female tumor cells differentially sensitive to BET inhibitors. These sex- biased gene expression patterns were also evident in human glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). In an established isogenic murine model of glioblastoma, we discovered correlated transcriptome-wide sex differences in gene expression, H3K27ac marks, large Brd4-bound enhancer usage, and Brd4 localization to Myc and p53 genomic binding sites. Thus, for the first time, Brd4 activity is revealed to drive a sex differences in stem cell and tumorigenic phenotype, resulting in diametrically opposite responses to BET inhibition in male and female GBM cells.

Last month, the FDA posted updated templates with recommendations for test developers to demonstrate validation for a test to be authorized for screening of asymptomatic people, as well as for sample pooling. The FDA reissued the LabCorp COVID-19 RT-PCR Test EUA to expand use of the test to anyone, after the company provided scientific data showing the tests ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a general, asymptomatic population. Additionally, the data reviewed by the FDA demonstrated that the test is as accurate in the broader asymptomatic population as it is among people suspected to have COVID-19. Until now, molecular diagnostic tests have generally been authorized for people suspected of having COVID-19 by their health care provider, which has allowed asymptomatic people to be tested, when warranted, at the discretion of the health care provider.

We further determined whether ACE2 expression in the cilia of upper respiratory cells was influenced by patient demographics, clinical characteristics, co-morbidities, or medication use, and found no evidence that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) increases ACE2 protein expression. ACE2 expression in the nasal cilia is not increased in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), but potentially decreased in ACEI patients.

Black and Latino people also report higher levels of vaccine hesitancy and distrust compared to white Americans, according to a recent survey by the COVID Collaborative, a coalition of national experts on health, education and the economy. Fueled by a dark history of medical experimentation and unequal access to care, people in Black and Latino communities struggling with high Covid-19 rates are among those least likely to get vaccinated, health advocates say. The damage inflicted by the Tuskegee Study and ongoing health care disparities, including lack of access to affordable medical care and to expensive pharmaceutical drugs, continues today as Blacks and Latinos remain leery of potential vaccines, advocates say.

PHE also warned that although those with antibodies have some protection from becoming ill with COVID-19 themselves, early evidence from the next stage of the study suggests that some of these individuals carry high levels of virus and could continue to transmit the virus to others. But a small number of people with antibodies may still be able to carry and transmit COVID-19 according to the study. iStock London, January 14 An official UK study released on Thursday concludes that a past COVID-19 infection provides some immunity for at least five months, but people may still carry and transmit coronavirus.

In the past few days, scientists working at feverish pace to develop vaccines against the coronavirus have released a flood of data from their first human trials. The vaccine is inducing the kind of immune responses that we think are inducing protection against coronavirus, said Sarah Gilbert, a vaccinologist co-leading the Oxford effort, in a press briefing announcing the results. But they suggest that the candidate vaccines are broadly safe, and offer the first hints that vaccines can summon immune responses similar to those of people who have been infected with the virus. Its definitely plausible that theres more than one way to protect against this virus. The nature of the immune response that protects  or fails to protect  against COVID-19 will become clearer when efficacy trials deliver their first results.

Yee estimates commissioning roughly two million COVID-19 test kits in the next two months from Nanjing-based Vazyme Biotech, a Chinese producer of enzymes and antibodies. The medtech company, which specializes in cancer treatment equipment and applications, has created a test kit that detects antibodies directed against the coronavirus thats sweeping the world. Meanwhile, Singapores Ministry of Health issued a document released to all registered medical practitioners on April 3 stating, There is currently no role for COVID-19 serology rapid test kits in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections. The Biolidics test checks the blood for antibodies and can identify who was previously infected and may have already developed immunity to the virus.

Among low-risk population, point-of-cares predictive values were 58.33% (positive) and 98.23% (negative) whereas venous blood tests were 92.86% (positive) and 98.53% (negative). Since Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli (FPG) IRCCS has been enlisted as a COVID hospital, healthcare workers deployed to COVID wards were separated from those with limited or no exposure, whereas administrative staff was destined to work-from-home.

Finally, RT-qPCR primers are designed to amplify the target regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Once virus mutation and recombination occur, it is difficult to effectively diagnose viral infection by existing RT-qPCR primers. There may be selective mutations in SARS-CoV-2, and it is necessary to avoid certain regions when designing primers and probes. The large- scale sustained person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has led to many mutational events, some of which may affect the sensitivity and specificity of available PCR assays (2). A mutation in a reverse primer has been shown to affect the sensitivity of an RT-qPCR assay in use early in the pandemic10 and further mutations could lead to the occurrence of false negative results, particularly if the mutation occurs at the extreme 3 end of the primers.
