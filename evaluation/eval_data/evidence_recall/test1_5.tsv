0	Here, we describe a collection of approaches based on SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped, single-cycle, replication-defective human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), as well as a replication-competent VSV/SARS- CoV-2 chimeric virus. While each surrogate virus exhibited subtle differences in the sensitivity with which neutralizing activity was detected, the neutralizing activity of both convalescent plasma and human monoclonal antibodies measured using each virus correlated quantitatively with neutralizing activity measured using an authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. The assays described herein are adaptable to high throughput and are useful tools in the evaluation of serologic immunity conferred by vaccination or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the potency of convalescent plasma or human monoclonal antibodies. ]: dot [@]: at [MHRA]: Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency [JCVI]: Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation [PMC]: Penske Media Corporation [ COVID-19]: coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]: coronavirus disease 2019 [v]: View this template [t]: telephone [e]: email []: You need to accept this checkbox.

A crown-like pore complex on coronavirus RCs ( 5) parallels a similar crown of viral proteins on nodavirus RCs ( 12), providing a channel to release RNA progeny to the cytoplasm. However, it is important to note that this intracellular DMV RC crown is unrelated to the crown-like halo of virion envelope spike proteins that gave coronaviruses their name ( 14). Crown- forming protein A contains all viral activities for RNA synthesis and shares distant sequence similarities to alphavirus RNA replication proteins ( 11 13).

36	Taiwan’s DCB Synthesizes Potential COVID-19 Treatment Favilavir As coronavirus cases continue to expand unstoppably around the globe, the focus is on discovering a vaccine. Status: Chinese authorities approved clinical trials of IFX-1 as a COVID-19 treatment in February. China’s National Health Commission has recommended the use of anti-IL6-R monoclonal antibodies to treat inflammation and elevated cytokine levels (cytokine storm) in COVID-19 patients. According to CanSino, the vaccine candidate is the first novel coronavirus vaccine for COVID-19 to advance to Phase I in China. Favilavir has been used by both Japan and China to treat severe cases of COVID-19, and the DCB team expects it to become a significant drug in treating the disease, according to the report.

45	One interesting observation was that it wasnt just individuals with verified COVID-19 who showed T-cell immunity but also many of their exposed asymptomatic family members, says Soo Aleman. Photo: Ulf Sirborn Our results indicate that public immunity to COVID-19 is probably significantly higher than antibody tests have suggested, says Professor Hans- Gustaf Ljunggren at the Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, and co-senior author. Patients with severe COVID-19 often developed a strong T-cell response and an antibody response; in those with milder symptoms it was not always possible to detect an antibody response, but despite this many still showed a marked T-cell response. Our results indicate that roughly twice as many people have developed T-cell immunity compared with those who we can detect antibodies in. In the present study, the researchers performed immunological analyses of samples from over 200 people, many of whom had mild or no symptoms of COVID-19. Larger and more longitudinal studies must now be done on both T cells and antibodies to understand how long-lasting the immunity is and how these different components of COVID-19 immunity are related, says Marcus Buggert.

That makes these frontline heroes helpful in another way in the fight against SARS-CoV-2: determining whether people who have recovered from COVID-19 can be reinfected by the virus.

53	In a peer review of the antibody study published to Medium, former Stanford lecturer Balaji Srinivasan, who specializes in statistics and computational biology, argued the selection methods could have overstated the prevalence of the disease in the county. The use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission. One of the most well-known attempts to justify sending workers back to offices and factories based on a supposed antibody count comes from the controversial Santa Clara study, as it has come to be known. Dr. Natalie E. Dean, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, tweeted that she had concerns with the adjustments made for clustering (some participants brought children and other household members with them to the test) and test characteristics (researchers assume no false positives but some false negatives). Srinivasan also exposed how the recruitment of people for the study inherently biased the results. The Stanford researchers acknowledged as much in the study and used test performance weights to scale results, but Rutherford was skeptical of these weights, as well as the population weights the researchers used.

Here, we show that iota-carrageenan can inhibit the cell entry of SSPL in a dose dependent manner. SSPL particles were efficiently neutralized with an IC50 value of 2.6 µg/ml iota-carrageenan. Attachment and entry of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the spike glycoprotein (SGP). In vitro data on iota-carrageenan against various Rhino- and Coronaviruses showed similar IC50 values and translated readily into clinical effectiveness when a nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan demonstrated a reduction in severity and duration of symptoms of common cold caused by various respiratory viruses.

The Sheffield Community Contact Tracers team was created by a group of retired doctors and public health experts and began the local pilot in April after they became frustrated by the lack of government action on contact tracing.1 In a report,2 the team described the inability or unwillingness to engage by people working in health and care settings as a major challenge. They said that contact tracing may be resisted in workplaces, especially in the NHS and care homes, where contact tracing systems, social distancing of staff, and a culture supportive of self-isolation frequently does not exist. They also found that one in five of the initial patients responded to phone calls only after a physical message was hand deliveredsomething that the UK government may want to consider as it launches new NHS test and trace services. The team behind the pilot have warned that test and trace schemes just launched in England and Scotland could be fraught with difficulties because of their centralised approach and their use of minimum wage employees at call centres.

72	Within this library, ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed human coronavirus replication in cultured cells, but did not suppress replication of respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus. These observations suggest that the effect of ciclesonide was specific to coronavirus, suggesting this is a candidate drug for treatment of patients suffering MERS or COVID-19. A recombinant virus with the mutation was also resistant to ciclesonide suppression of viral replication. After the eleventh consecutive MERS-CoV passage in the presence of ciclesonide, a resistant mutation was generated, which resulted in an amino acid substitution (A25V) in nonstructural protein (NSP) 15, as identified using reverse genetics. ]: dot [@]: at [MHRA]: Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency [JCVI]: Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation [PMC]: Penske Media Corporation [ COVID-19]: coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]: coronavirus disease 2019 [v]: View this template [t]: Discuss this template [e]: Edit this template []: You need to accept this checkbox.

77	The approach that we used for designing potential peptide vaccine candidates takes a more personalized strategy, referred to as vaccinomics , which enables the selection of target viral proteins with low mutation rates, and the design of peptides tuned to the immune characteristics of the target populations, variable based on geographic location and ethnicity. The candidate peptides were designed by applying to viral antigens a technology used for personalized vaccination in cancer, based on long neoantigen peptides, currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy. Technical details of the approach used are detailed below: We identified multiepitope peptide vaccine candidates against nCov that can potentially trigger both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune response. The selection of the peptides that could act as vaccines is determined by the binding of the processed viral peptide with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules, and the relevant HLA alleles. Based on the human MHC (human leukocyte antigen) allele variation, the peptide vaccines can be made more relevant to a community or individual.

81	New AI model detects asymptomatic Covid-19 infections through device-recorded coughs Vocal sentiments Prior to the pandemics onset, research groups already had been training algorithms on cellphone recordings of coughs to accurately diagnose conditions such as pneumonia and asthma. When they fed the model new cough recordings, it accurately identified 98.5 percent of coughs from people who were confirmed to have Covid-19, including 100 percent of coughs from asymptomatics  who reported they did not have symptoms but had tested positive for the virus. Close Caption: MIT researchers have found that people who are asymptomatic for Covid-19 may differ from healthy individuals in the way that they cough. The model identified 98.5 percent of coughs from people confirmed with Covid-19, and of those, it accurately detected all of the asymptomatic coughs. When the coronavirus pandemic began to unfold, Subirana wondered whether their AI framework for Alzheimers might also work for diagnosing Covid-19, as there was growing evidence that infected patients experienced some similar neurological symptoms such as temporary neuromuscular impairment.

94	One Sentence Summary We developed a mathematical model to explain why remdesivir has a greater antiviral effect on SARS CoV-2 in lung versus nasal passages in rhesus macaques. We demonstrate with sensitivity analysis that a drug with higher potency could completely suppress viral replication and lower viral loads abruptly in the nasal passages as well as the lung. We identified that 1) drug potency is slightly higher in nasal passages than in lungs, 2) viral load decrease in lungs relative to nasal passages during therapy because of infection-dependent generation of refractory cells in the lung, 3) incomplete drug potency in the lung that decreases viral loads even slightly may allow substantially less lung damage, and 4) increases in nasal viral load may occur due to a slight blunting of peak viral load and subsequent decrease of the intensity of the innate immune response, as well as a lack of refractory cells. In rhesus macaques, early initiation of remdesivir therapy prevented pneumonia and lowered viral loads in the lung, but viral loads increased in the nasal passages five days after therapy. ]: dot [@]: at [MHRA]: Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency [JCVI]: Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation [PMC]: Penske Media Corporation [ COVID-19]: coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]: coronavirus disease 2019 [v]: View this template [t]: telephone [e]: email []: You need to accept this checkbox.

Although SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, most humans had been previously exposed to other antigenically distinct common seasonal human coronaviruses (hCoVs) before the COVID-19 pandemic. We determined that 23% of these individuals possessed non- neutralizing antibodies that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. We then quantified pre-pandemic antibody levels in serum from a separate cohort of 252 individuals who became PCR-confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Whether the proteins have been neutralized by so-called auto- antibodies, or were not produced in sufficient amounts in the first place due to a faulty gene, their missing-in-action appears to be a common theme among a subgroup of COVID-19 sufferers whose disease has thus far been a mystery. Genetics of COVID-19 outliers The way SARS-CoV-2 affects people differently has been puzzling. These findings provide compelling evidence that the disruption of type I interferon is often the cause of life-threatening COVID-19, says Jean-Laurent Casanova, head of the St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases at The Rockefeller University and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. COVID-19 may now be the best understood acute infectious disease in terms of having a molecular and genetic explanation for nearly 15 percent of critical cases across diverse ancestries, Casanova says.

Furthermore, the HCV replication complexes may hide the viral RNA from recognition by host sensors (43). EndoU activity delays recognition by the host innate immune sensors, and thus is a highly conserved virulence factor and a potential target for antiviral and vaccine strategies. Here, we report that EndoU cleaves a viral polyuridine sequence that would otherwise activate host immune sensors. The VPg linkage may prevent the exposure of a polyU structure to host sensors, thus preventing the polyU sequence from acting as a PAMP.

145	Pharmacological PLP supplementation may therefore mitigate COVID-19 symptoms by alleviating both the immune suppression underlying viral spread and the pathological hypersecretion of inflammatory cytokines, as well as directly bolstering endothelial integrity and preventing hypercoagulability. Severe COVID-19 manifests as an imbalance in the immune response and the clotting system. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) tends to be insufficient in populations particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, including the elderly, the institutionalized, and people with diabetes and CVD, and PLP becomes further depleted during infection and inflammation. In turn, low PLP results in immune imbalance, as PLP is an essential cofactor in pathways regulating cytokine production, in particular type I interferons and IL-6, and in lymphocyte trafficking and endothelial integrity. In inflammatory disease, pharmacological doses of PLP decrease circulating TNFα, IL-6 and D-dimer, and animal studies demonstrate that supplemental PLP shortens the duration and severity of viral pneumonia.

156	Using global line-list data on COVID-19 cases reported until 29th February 2020 and global gridded temperature data, and after adjusting for surveillance capacity and time since first imported case, higher average temperature was strongly associated with lower COVID-19 incidence for temperatures of 1°C and higher. However, temperature explained a relatively modest amount of the total variation in COVID-19 incidence. These preliminary findings support stringent containment efforts in Europe and elsewhere.

187	In summary, data presented here demonstrated that a ferritin-NP-based preS1 vaccine manifests an efficient antibody response that is both preventive and therapeutic in a mouse HBV model via coordinately dual-targeting SIGNR1+ resident DCs and macrophages in the LNs. We describe the structure-based design of self-assembling protein nanoparticle immunogens that elicit potent and protective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. Furthermore, rabbits immunized with the trimer-bearing nanoparticles induced significantly higher neutralizing antibody responses against most tier 1A viruses, and higher responses (but not significantly), to several tier 1B viruses and the autologous tier 2 virus than when the same trimers were delivered as sol. Taken together, these results provide insights into the development of SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and demonstrate that spike-functionalized ferritin nanoparticles elicit an enhanced antibody response compared to the spike trimers or RBD alone. After a single immunization of mice with either of the two spike ferritin particles, a lentiviral SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay revealed mean neutralizing antibody titers at least 2-fold greater than those in convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients.

Hydroxychloroquine, an antiviral medication that has been used primarily in treating malaria and for autoimmune diseases, has been touted as an effective treatment for and prophylactic against COVID-19 by a number of physicians and public figures. People who have had close contact with people with confirmed COVID-19 infections who took hydroxychloroquine were just as likely to get COVID-19 as were those who received a placebo, according to a preliminary data analysis from a large randomized, controlled trial. The additional data we have today provides strong evidence that hydroxychloroquine offers no benefit in preventing people developing COVID-19 with a 14-day treatment course.

These immune mediators are transcriptionally regulated by JAK- STAT molecular pathways, which can be disabled by small molecules. The majority of patients with COVID-19 have a good prognosis, but variable percentages in different countries develop pneumonia associated with lymphocytopenia and severe inflammatory response due to uncontrolled release of cytokines. Indeed, we demonstrate a significant reduction in serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, a rapid recovery in circulating T and B cell frequencies and an increased antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in baricitinib-treated patients.

The White House doesn't have high confidence in the information coming out of China regarding the count of coronavirus cases, a senior administration official told CNBC last week. For too long in this outbreak, for example, China only counted people with pneumonia as cases — a fact that blocked their ability to detect people with mild infections. Earlier this month, officials from Heilongjiang province in northeast China announced that 13 people who had tested positive for the virus with a lab test but who had no symptoms had been removed from the region’s list of confirmed cases. (Separately, China's health commission on Feb. 14 said it removed 108 deaths from its total count to correct some double-counting in Hubei province, which doesn't appear to have stemmed from the methodology change.)

210	Antibody testing is done by means of blood drawn through a finger prick and detects whether your blood has antibodies that are present when the body is responding to an infection, like COVID-19. Mayor Martin J. Walsh, together with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC), today announced the study to evaluate community exposure to COVID-19 through a representative sampling of asymptomatic Boston residents resulted in 9.9% testing positive for antibodies and 2.6% of currently asymptomatic individuals testing positive for COVID-19. Prevalence of COVID-19 positivity in currently asymptomatic individuals ranged from 1.1% to 4.6%, while antibody positivity ranged from 6.3% to 13.3% by zip code. There were no significant differences in COVID-19 or antibody rates by race or ethnicity in this sample. In conclusion, approximately 1 in 10 residents in this study have developed antibodies and approximately 1 in 40 currently asymptomatic individuals are positive for COVID-19 and potentially infectious.

212	WHO currently recommends that people should wear face masks if they have respiratory symptoms or if they are caring for somebody with symptoms. It is essential for people who are symptomatic (even if they have mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask. This can be difficult when others are wearing masks that cover large portions of their face. Perhaps it would also be rational to recommend that people in quarantine wear face masks if they need to leave home for any reason, to prevent potential asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission. Wearing a face covering can help to reduce the chance that those who may not know they are sick will spread the infection to others.

215	Uncertainty is hampering doctors’ ability to choose treatments Numerous studies have suggested that the immune system contributes to the organ damage seen in some severe cases of COVID-19. For patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19, there isn't just one way for the immune system to respond. The authors found no evidence that the variant of concern causes more severe COVID-19 than other variants. Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals have a key role in COVID-19 transmission, which makes it difficult to control the disease without strict social distancing, the authors say.

227	Model predictions fail because the observed infection rates are beyond modeling: any model that uses fixed rates or uses memory or averages of past rates cannot reproduce the data on active infections. Second, model building does not and cannot reflect real epidemic data because the only correct rates emerge day by day in the daily data, cannot be usefully forecast for more than a few days in advance, and cannot be forecast at all correctly near a peak. SUMMARYREFERENCES The pandemic infection rates to two to three decimal places are an example of complexity: the infection rates can be calculated daily from the infections but they cannot be modeled and predicted from fixed initial conditions. However, there is no such relationship between a past average and future rate jumps in real infection data. However, since the real, observed data do not obey (24), this ansatz unfortunately does not inform us about epidemics.	Pandemic infection rates are deterministic but can not be modeled	entailment
228	Pandemic Infection Rates Are Deterministic but Cannot Be Modeled  It is essential to simulate the process of infection (and death) in advance so as to apply adequate control measures and mitigate the risk of virus diffusion. You can watch the unfolding, you can take measures to reduce infections, but you cannot predict when the active infections will flatten, or will peak and then decay, or if they will merely flatten without peaking. For a specific disease in a specific population, these functions may be worked out in order to predict possible outbreaks and bring them under control. These calculations indicate the uncertainty in the determination of the parameters of the epidemic, but the solutions have to be restricted to reasonable values of the properties of the disease and parameters of the epidemic.

229	Pandemic Infection Rates Are Deterministic but Cannot Be Modeled  Since our model consists of only one deterministic equation it is simpler compared to most approaches but is nevertheless able to capture the time course of the epidemic.

You can watch the unfolding, you can take measures to reduce infections, but you cannot predict when the active infections will flatten, or will peak and then decay, or if they will merely flatten without peaking.

249	Herein, we showed that the protease inhibitor aprotinin (but not the protease inhibitor SERPINA1/alpha-1 antitrypsin) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in therapeutically achievable concentrations. In conclusion, therapeutic aprotinin concentrations exert anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. An analysis of proteomics and translatome data indicated that SARS-CoV-2 replication is associated with a downregulation of host cell protease inhibitors. Aprotinin displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in different cell types (Caco2, Calu-3, and primary bronchial epithelial cell air-liquid interface cultures) and against four virus isolates.

Earlier in the outbreak, doctors warned that a larger outbreak of the new coronavirus across the U.S. could overwhelm emergency rooms and quickly cause supply shortages of some crucial medical supplies. A patient was brought into the hospitals ICU unit; the patient tested negative for flu but did not meet the CDCs guidelines for coronavirus testing. Under this example, the market could not be able to recreate enough vaccines if the USA is attacked.

While we're waiting for a vaccine, drugs currently being used to treat other illnesses can be investigated as treatments for COVID-19  in other words repurposed, said Dr Steve Alexander from the University of Nottingham. These treatments will have already been shown to be safe and so, if they can now be shown to be effective in COVID-19, they could be brought to clinical use relatively quickly. One promising candidate is remdesivir, a drug originally developed for Ebola.

278	Mucus production stimulated by IFN-AhR signaling triggers hypoxia of COVID-19. In this study, mucus in either membrane- bound or secreted form, produced by alveolar epithelial cells in the alveoli of COVID-19 patients or SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2-transgenic mice or rhesus macaques, can adhere to the gas–blood barrier and increase the thickness, thus hindering gas diffusion. These findings potentially explain the silent hypoxia formation in COVID-19 patients, and suggest a possible intervention strategy by targeting the AhR pathway. Indeed, clinical observation has found that critically ill patients with normal PCO2 can be rescued, while it is very difficult to rescue patients with altered PCO2.31 Therefore, targeting IFN-triggered AhR pathway might be a potential strategy to effectively treat COVID-19 patients.

A mass vaccination team will be set up in each of the nine Highway Patrol regions in the state, he said, and they will be able to administer up to 2,500 doses a day. In Los Angeles, the rate of death among hospitalized COVID-19 patients has nearly doubled in recent months. That rate marks a significant increase from the prior three months when COVID-19 patients had an approximately 12% chance of dying, according to the county's Department of Health Services. Biden signed several orders including improving supply chains for the pandemic, keeping workers safe, ensuring an equitable response, promoting safe travel, and expanding treatment for COVID-19.

Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, COVID-19 has been responsible for more than 170,000 deaths and over 5.4 million infections in the United States. Among persons aged <19 years, an estimated annual average of 97 (range: 41 in 1981--82 to 234 in 1977--78) influenza-associated deaths with underlying pneumonia and influenza causes occurred (Table 1). Prominent influenza type and subtype were defined as at least 20% of all isolates that were tested in that season.

290	The study provides insight into how limited testing and gaps in surveillance during the initial phase of the epidemic resulted in so many cases going undetected. The potential for misdiagnosis and the limitations of surveillance are huge issues across infectious diseases, especially emerging infectious diseases, he added. A significant aspect of the analysis is the model's incorporation of many uncertainties that played out in the early days of the epidemic in the US, which Perkins said speaks to the inherent nature of a novel and emerging infectious disease. As illustrated in the COVID-19 study, while public health officials must work quickly to understand how a new virus functions, without appropriate testing or coordinated response strategies the risk grows for infections to go unreported. Part of it was the availability of testing, but another huge part was case definitions and the fact that they were overly restrictive early on.

291	It is important to maintain a comprehensive system for influenza surveillance for the following reasons: Influenza viruses are constantly changing (referred to as antigenic drift), and thus ongoing data collection and characterization of the viruses are required; Influenza viruses can also undergo an abrupt, major change (referred to as antigenic shift) that results in a virus that is different than currently circulating influenza viruses; surveillance of viruses will detect these changes and inform the public health response; Vaccines must be administered annually and are updated regularly based on surveillance findings; Treatment for influenza is guided by laboratory surveillance for antiviral resistance; and Influenza surveillance and targeted research studies are used to monitor the impact of influenza on different segments of the population (e.g. The flu season is said to have started after consecutive weeks of elevated flu activity is registered in the various CDC influenza surveillance systems. Newly reported cases of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are reported in FluView and additional information, including case counts by geographic location, virus subtype, and calendar year, are available on FluView Interactive. Widespread: Outbreaks of influenza or increases in ILI cases and recent laboratory-confirmed influenza in at least half the regions of the state with recent laboratory evidence of influenza in the state. The potential for misdiagnosis and the limitations of surveillance are huge issues across infectious diseases, especially emerging infectious diseases, he added.

292	CONCLUSIONS : In our cohort of COVID-19 patients, immunosuppression was associated with a lower risk of moderate-severe ARDS. The role of immunosuppression among COVID-19 patients has not been elucidated and management may be challenging. OBJECTIVE : To assess differences in severe outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 according to immune system state. A positive non-significant trend toward a longer time to moderate or severe ARDS, a lower need for MV/NIV, and a lower risk of death or MV/NIV were detected in IC. This suggests a potential protective effect from a hypothesized host hyper-inflammatory response and warrants reconsideration of drug discontinuation in IC patients.

303	Some people taken by Covid-19 would likely have died from these diseases even in the five-month time frame. Hyacinth Empinado/STAT Covid-19 is particularly severe in — and more likely to kill — the elderly and people with existing illnesses, including heart disease. Hopefully better treatment protocols will be coming as the research data comes in and the estimates can continue to be lowered. You may believe a different methodology paints a truer picture of how Covid-19 deaths compare to others. Unless laboratory work has been performed to diagnose Salmonellosis and determine antibiotic sensitivity, oral antibiotics should NOT be used -- they will kill the beneficial intestinal bacteria that compete with Salmonella organisms and help slow down their multiplication.

304	These observations led us to hypothesize that Brd4-bound enhancers might underlie sex differences in stem cell function and tumorigenicity in GBM. We report that sex-biased Brd4 activity drive sex differences in GBM and render male and female tumor cells differentially sensitive to BET inhibitors. Thus, for the first time, Brd4 activity is revealed to drive a sex differences in stem cell and tumorigenic phenotype, resulting in diametrically opposite responses to BET inhibition in male and female GBM cells. In an established isogenic murine model of glioblastoma, we discovered correlated transcriptome-wide sex differences in gene expression, H3K27ac marks, large Brd4-bound enhancer usage, and Brd4 localization to Myc and p53 genomic binding sites. These sex- biased gene expression patterns were also evident in human glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs).	Brd4-bound enhancers drive cell intrinsic sex differences in glioblastoma	entailment

318	Additionally, the data reviewed by the FDA demonstrated that the test is as accurate in the broader asymptomatic population as it is among people suspected to have COVID-19. Last week, the FDA authorized the first COVID-19 test that could be used with pooled samples. Until now, molecular diagnostic tests have generally been authorized for people suspected of having COVID-19 by their health care provider, which has allowed asymptomatic people to be tested, when warranted, at the discretion of the health care provider. Last month, the FDA posted updated templates with recommendations for test developers to demonstrate validation for a test to be authorized for screening of asymptomatic people, as well as for sample pooling. The FDA reissued the LabCorp COVID-19 RT-PCR Test EUA to expand use of the test to anyone, after the company provided scientific data showing the tests ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a general, asymptomatic population.

320	This is the second time trials for a Covid-19 vaccine trial have been paused over a safety concern. Last month, AstraZeneca PLC paused clinical trials of an experimental Covid-19 vaccine after a participant in a U.K. study had an unexplained illness. The guidelines ensure our studies may be paused if an unexpected serious adverse event that might be related to a vaccine or study drug is reported, so there can be a careful review of all of the medical information before deciding whether to restart the study, the company said. Vaccines typically take years to bring to market, and many often don't make it because they fail to work safely during testing. AstraZeneca's trials were paused after a woman in a U.K. study of their vaccine had an unexplained illness, which a U.S. health official described as a spinal-cord problem.

321	Johnson & Johnson pauses COVID-19 vaccine trials due to sick subject Share: October 13, 2020  Though clinical trial pauses are not uncommon — and in some cases last only a few days — they are generating outsized attention in the race to test vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. After a participant in one of its coronavirus vaccine trials became sick with an unexplained illness, manufacturer Johnson & Johnson announced Monday that it has suspended its COVID-19 vaccine investigations. +++ Statement from October 12, 2020 Johnson & Johnson Temporarily Pauses All Dosing in Our Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate Clinical Trials At Johnson & Johnson, there is no greater priority than the safety and well being of the people we serve every day around the world. “In a small village there are a lot of medical events that happen.” On Sept. 8, a large study of another Covid-19 vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University was put on hold because of a suspected adverse reaction in a patient in the United Kingdom.

322	Therefore, it is likely that most nonparticipants were not in Wuhan at the time of the screening. Therefore, the estimated positive rates are unlikely to be materially influenced by nonparticipation of residents who were not in Wuhan or some residents who did not participate in the screening for other reasons. Prevention measures taken at Sanmin residential community in WuhanXinhua  In summary, the detection rate of asymptomatic positive cases in the post- lockdown Wuhan was very low (0.303/10,000), and there was no evidence that the identified asymptomatic positive cases were infectious. We found that asymptomatic positive rates in different districts of Wuhan were correlated with the prevalence of previously confirmed cases.

324	A study from Wuhan, China, also found that asymptomatic patients may only be contagious for half as long as symptomatic patients. In summary, the detection rate of asymptomatic positive cases in the post- lockdown Wuhan was very low (0.303/10,000), and there was no evidence that the identified asymptomatic positive cases were infectious. To err on safe side, it may be wise to presume that asymptomatic cases are also infectious. But the Wuhan study suggests that asymptomatic coronavirus patients don't shed the virus for as much time. Fujian Song, from UEA’s Norwich Medical School, who collaborated with colleagues in Wuhan on the research, said: “The asymptomatic cases identified in the screening programme were truly asymptomatic, as none of them showed clinical symptoms before or during their follow-up isolation.” But, he added, “there is plenty of evidence elsewhere showing that people infected with covid-19 may be temporarily asymptomatic and infectious, before going on to develop symptoms.” Using antibody testing, the researchers found that almost two thirds of the asymptomatic cases had previously had covid-19.

326	ACE2 mRNA and protein expression are not found in goblet cells of the respiratory tract. We further determined whether ACE2 expression in the cilia of upper respiratory cells was influenced by patient demographics, clinical characteristics, co-morbidities, or medication use, and found no evidence that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) increases ACE2 protein expression. ACE2 expression in the nasal cilia is not increased in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), but potentially decreased in ACEI patients. ACE2 mRNA and protein expression are not found in goblet Extended Data Fig. ACE2 mRNA expression (red dots) was not noted within goblet cells marked by MUC5AC in the nasal turbinate, uncinate process, and trachea.

327	First, we discover that ACE2 is robustly expressed in the motile cilia of the respiratory tract. In conclusion, we find that ACE2 protein expression is not only present in epithelial cells lining the human respiratory tract, but that on a subcellular level, it is enriched in the motile cilia of the respiratory airway. In conclusion, we find that ACE2 protein expression is not only present in ciliated epithelial cells in the human respiratory tract, but that on a subcellular level, it is enriched in the motile cilia organelle of the ciliated epithelium. Given that motile cilia comprise the outer apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells, this result supports a model in which SARS-CoV-2 first binds ACE2 present in the motile cilia of the upper airway prior to entry into ciliated epithelial cells. Here, we report our discovery that the ACE2 receptor protein robustly localizes within the motile cilia of airway epithelial cells, which likely represents the initial or early subcellular site of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry during host respiratory transmission.

330	Here we identify a consensus peripheral blood immune signature across 63 hospital-treated Covid-19 patients who were otherwise highly heterogeneous. Moreover, specific parameters including CXCL10/IP10 over- expression, T cell proliferation, and basophil and plasmacytoid dendritic cell depletion correlated, often prognostically, with Covid-19 progression, collectively composing a resource to inform SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology and risk- based patient stratification. By comparison to paucisymptomatic virus clearance by most individuals, Covid-19 has been proposed to reflect insufficient and/or pathologically exaggerated immune responses. The core signature conspicuously blended adaptive B cell responses typical of virus infection or vaccination with discrete traits hitherto associated with sepsis, including monocyte and dendritic cell dampening, and hyperactivation and depletion of discrete T cell subsets. ]: dot [@]: at [MHRA]: Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency [JCVI]: Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation [PMC]: Penske Media Corporation [ COVID-19]: coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]: coronavirus disease 2019 [v]: View this template [t]: telephone [e]: email []: You need to accept this checkbox.

PHE also warned that although those with antibodies have some protection from becoming ill with COVID-19 themselves, early evidence from the next stage of the study suggests that some of these individuals carry high levels of virus and could continue to transmit the virus to others. The PHE also warned that although those with antibodies have some protection from becoming ill with COVID-19 themselves, early evidence from the next stage of the study suggests that some of these individuals carry high levels of virus and could continue to transmit the virus to others. Published 14 January 2021 From: Public Health England People infected with COVID-19 in the past are likely to be protected against reinfection for several months, a Public Health England (PHE) study has found, although experts cautioned those with immunity may still be able carry the virus in their nose and throat and therefore have a risk of transmitting to others. iStock London, January 14 An official UK study released on Thursday concludes that a past COVID-19 infection provides some immunity for at least five months, but people may still carry and transmit coronavirus.

356	At this time, experts do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. From what we know of other viruses, most experts think it’s likely that most people who recover from COVID-19 have some level of immunity for some period of time. That means it's possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and still get sick. Being protected from getting sick is important because even though many people with COVID-19 have only a mild illness, others may get a severe illness, have long-term health effects , or even die. The short answer is that people who have recovered from COVID-19 cannot spread the virus to others unless they become reinfected themselves.

357	Taken together, our results allow an explanation for differences in susceptibility towards IFNs and provide evidence that rational immune activation may be an effective future therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2. Overall our analyses revealed that IFN-γ and IFN-λ1 signalling are antagonised the least, leaving SARS-CoV-2 highly susceptible to these two cytokines. Their combination synergistically potentiated the anti-viral effects against SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. However, SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 is strikingly more potent in suppressing IFN induction and signalling than its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. Here, we systematically analysed the impact of 29 SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins on three major arms of our cell-intrinsic innate immune defences: interferon (IFN) induction, cytokine signalling and autophagy.

363	But they suggest that the candidate vaccines are broadly safe, and offer the first hints that vaccines can summon immune responses similar to those of people who have been infected with the virus. Vaccines expose the immune system to components of a virus  the coronavirus spike protein, in the case of nearly all COVID-19 vaccines  in the hope of teaching it how to react against a real infection in the future. In the past few days, scientists working at feverish pace to develop vaccines against the coronavirus have released a flood of data from their first human trials. The vaccine is inducing the kind of immune responses that we think are inducing protection against coronavirus, said Sarah Gilbert, a vaccinologist co-leading the Oxford effort, in a press briefing announcing the results. Its definitely plausible that theres more than one way to protect against this virus. The nature of the immune response that protects  or fails to protect  against COVID-19 will become clearer when efficacy trials deliver their first results.

364	During this phase, researchers will continue to evaluate vaccine dosing and immune response. Even as these ‘first in human’ trials get going, key questions about how our immune system fights off the virus — and how to safely trigger a similar immune response with a vaccine — remain unanswered. Similar safety trials of other coronavirus vaccines will also begin soon. Researchers continue to test the vaccine for safety and effectiveness in larger groups of volunteers. Here are some of the key questions that scientists hope to answer to develop a coronavirus vaccine.	Coronavirus vaccines remain through safety trials	not_entailment

380	There may be selective mutations in SARS-CoV-2, and it is necessary to avoid certain regions when designing primers and probes. The large- scale sustained person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has led to many mutational events, some of which may affect the sensitivity and specificity of available PCR assays (2). Finally, RT-qPCR primers are designed to amplify the target regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. A mutation in a reverse primer has been shown to affect the sensitivity of an RT-qPCR assay in use early in the pandemic10 and further mutations could lead to the occurrence of false negative results, particularly if the mutation occurs at the extreme 3 end of the primers. Once virus mutation and recombination occur, it is difficult to effectively diagnose viral infection by existing RT-qPCR primers.

381	A mutation in a reverse primer has been shown to affect the sensitivity of an RT-qPCR assay in use early in the pandemic10 and further mutations could lead to the occurrence of false negative results, particularly if the mutation occurs at the extreme 3′ end of the primers. Here we report a novel N gene mutation (C29200A) seen in 3 patients, which affected the detection of SARS-CoV-2 N gene by a commercial assay. Three SARS-CoV-2 targets, Nsp10, N-gene and Nsp12, were chosen to accommodate sequence variabilities in primer or probe locations and minimise the likelihood of a 3′-mutation at primer binding sites reducing the reliability of the assay. This has resulted in some confusion as to whether these diagnostic assays are capable of adequately addressing their three main functions: First, to identify patients presenting with symptoms consistent with COVID19 as SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative. CoV2-ID targets three viral genes, as this allows scope for the test to remain accurate even if mutations arise at the 3′-ends of the primers that could result in false-negative results.

388	However, the disappearance of SARS-CoV infection prevented efficacy testing of these vaccines. Progress and prospects on vaccine development against SARS- CoV-2. A key question yet to be addressed is whether SARS-CoV-2 infection induces long-lasting protective immunity, and if so whether it will simply protect from severe disease or provide sterilising immunity. Evidence points to a lack of a pre-existing immunity offering cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2. While it has been found to be highly immunogenic, it has been reported that antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 do not provide immunity to infection.
