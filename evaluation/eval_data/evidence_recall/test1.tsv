31	Severe allergy-like reactions in at least eight people who received the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech over the past 2 weeks may be due to a compound in the packaging of the messenger RNA (mRNA) that forms the vaccines main ingredient, scientists say. Patients with severe allergies in the US are getting nervous about the possibility that they may not be able to get vaccinated, at least with those two vaccines, Togias wrote in an invitation to meeting participants. Some allergists and immunologists believe a small number of people previously exposed to PEG may have high levels of antibodies against PEG, putting them at risk of an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine. NIAID is also setting up a study in collaboration with FDA to analyze the response to the vaccine in people who have high levels of anti-PEG antibodies or have experienced severe allergic responses to drugs or vaccines before.

56	The use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission. One of the most well-known attempts to justify sending workers back to offices and factories based on a supposed antibody count comes from the controversial Santa Clara study, as it has come to be known. The Stanford researchers acknowledged as much in the study and used test performance weights to scale results, but Rutherford was skeptical of these weights, as well as the population weights the researchers used. In a peer review of the antibody study published to Medium, former Stanford lecturer Balaji Srinivasan, who specializes in statistics and computational biology, argued the selection methods could have overstated the prevalence of the disease in the county. Dr. Natalie E. Dean, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, tweeted that she had concerns with the adjustments made for clustering (some participants brought children and other household members with them to the test) and test characteristics (researchers assume no false positives but some false negatives).

Dean, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, tweeted that she had concerns with the adjustments made for clustering (some participants brought children and other household members with them to the test) and test characteristics (researchers assume no false positives but some false negatives).	Stanford professor balaji s. srinivasan's peer review of the santa clara seroprevalence study indicates that its high reported positive rate results cannot be explained by the false positive rate of the test and/or by sample recruitment issues.	not_entailment

After the eleventh consecutive MERS-CoV passage in the presence of ciclesonide, a resistant mutation was generated, which resulted in an amino acid substitution (A25V) in nonstructural protein (NSP) 15, as identified using reverse genetics.

80	The candidate peptides were designed by applying to viral antigens a technology used for personalized vaccination in cancer, based on long neoantigen peptides, currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy. Technical details of the approach used are detailed below: We identified multiepitope peptide vaccine candidates against nCov that can potentially trigger both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune response. The approach that we used for designing potential peptide vaccine candidates takes a more personalized strategy, referred to as vaccinomics , which enables the selection of target viral proteins with low mutation rates, and the design of peptides tuned to the immune characteristics of the target populations, variable based on geographic location and ethnicity. Based on the human MHC (human leukocyte antigen) allele variation, the peptide vaccines can be made more relevant to a community or individual. The selection of the peptides that could act as vaccines is determined by the binding of the processed viral peptide with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules, and the relevant HLA alleles.

233	Model predictions fail because the observed infection rates are beyond modeling: any model that uses fixed rates or uses memory or averages of past rates cannot reproduce the data on active infections. SUMMARYREFERENCES The pandemic infection rates to two to three decimal places are an example of complexity: the infection rates can be calculated daily from the infections but they cannot be modeled and predicted from fixed initial conditions. Second, model building does not and cannot reflect real epidemic data because the only correct rates emerge day by day in the daily data, cannot be usefully forecast for more than a few days in advance, and cannot be forecast at all correctly near a peak.

307	These observations led us to hypothesize that Brd4-bound enhancers might underlie sex differences in stem cell function and tumorigenicity in GBM. We report that sex-biased Brd4 activity drive sex differences in GBM and render male and female tumor cells differentially sensitive to BET inhibitors. These sex- biased gene expression patterns were also evident in human glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). In an established isogenic murine model of glioblastoma, we discovered correlated transcriptome-wide sex differences in gene expression, H3K27ac marks, large Brd4-bound enhancer usage, and Brd4 localization to Myc and p53 genomic binding sites. Thus, for the first time, Brd4 activity is revealed to drive a sex differences in stem cell and tumorigenic phenotype, resulting in diametrically opposite responses to BET inhibition in male and female GBM cells.

Published 14 January 2021 From: Public Health England People infected with COVID-19 in the past are likely to be protected against reinfection for several months, a Public Health England (PHE) study has found, although experts cautioned those with immunity may still be able carry the virus in their nose and throat and therefore have a risk of transmitting to others. PHE also warned that although those with antibodies have some protection from becoming ill with COVID-19 themselves, early evidence from the next stage of the study suggests that some of these individuals carry high levels of virus and could continue to transmit the virus to others. But a small number of people with antibodies may still be able to carry and transmit COVID-19 according to the study. iStock London, January 14 An official UK study released on Thursday concludes that a past COVID-19 infection provides some immunity for at least five months, but people may still carry and transmit coronavirus.

366	Vaccines expose the immune system to components of a virus  the coronavirus spike protein, in the case of nearly all COVID-19 vaccines  in the hope of teaching it how to react against a real infection in the future. In the past few days, scientists working at feverish pace to develop vaccines against the coronavirus have released a flood of data from their first human trials. The vaccine is inducing the kind of immune responses that we think are inducing protection against coronavirus, said Sarah Gilbert, a vaccinologist co-leading the Oxford effort, in a press briefing announcing the results. But they suggest that the candidate vaccines are broadly safe, and offer the first hints that vaccines can summon immune responses similar to those of people who have been infected with the virus. Its definitely plausible that theres more than one way to protect against this virus. The nature of the immune response that protects  or fails to protect  against COVID-19 will become clearer when efficacy trials deliver their first results.

383	Finally, RT-qPCR primers are designed to amplify the target regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Once virus mutation and recombination occur, it is difficult to effectively diagnose viral infection by existing RT-qPCR primers. There may be selective mutations in SARS-CoV-2, and it is necessary to avoid certain regions when designing primers and probes. The large- scale sustained person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has led to many mutational events, some of which may affect the sensitivity and specificity of available PCR assays (2). A mutation in a reverse primer has been shown to affect the sensitivity of an RT-qPCR assay in use early in the pandemic10 and further mutations could lead to the occurrence of false negative results, particularly if the mutation occurs at the extreme 3 end of the primers.
