Our companion diagnostics showed that after three days of therapy, the immune profile in these patients approached normal levels and the levels of cytokines involved in the cytokine storm were much improved. Jacob Lalezari, M.D., Interim Chief Medical Officer of CytoDyn, commented, These preliminary results give hope that leronlimab may help hospitalized patients with COVID-19 recover from the pulmonary inflammation that drives mortality and the need for ventilators. The treatment with leronlimab is targeted as a therapy for patients who experience respiratory complications as a result of contracting SARS-CoV-2 causing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Moreover, a Phase 2b clinical trial demonstrated that leronlimab monotherapy can prevent viral escape in HIV-infected patients; some patients on leronlimab monotherapy have remained virally suppressed for more than five years. Clinical results to date from multiple trials have shown that leronlimab can significantly reduce viral burden in people infected with HIV with no reported drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs).

The GD/P2S dataset2 contains reads that are identical to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting either the coexistence of two SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the same pangolin or contamination by the human virus. To overcome this absence, I assembled these genomes from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data available for SARS- CoV-2-like viruses detected in five captive pangolins from Guangdong.

The fact that bifidobacterial surface proteins were able to recognize specific classes of cytokines supported the team's theory: these bacteria are also capable of regulating our immune response. A fragment of this protein can be used as an anti-inflammatory medication when treating coronavirus and other diseases.

We developed an antagonistic peptide that inhibits S1-ACE2 interaction and CoV2-S1-induced productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here we demonstrate that 2019 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 (CoV2-S1) induces high levels of NF-κB activations, production of pro- inflammatory cytokines and mild epithelial damage, in human bronchial epithelial cells.

Eventually, as the science develops, the industry will be able to make the necessary adjustments and install the bulbs in robotic systems or air conditioning, vacuum, and water systems, and thereby be able to efficiently disinfect large surfaces and spaces. Disinfection systems based on LED bulbs, however, can be installed in the ventilation system and air conditioner, for example, and sterilize the air sucked in and then emitted into the room. In the future, the researchers will test their unique combination of integrated damage mechanisms and more ideas they recently developed on combined efficient direct and indirect damage to bacteria and viruses on different surfaces, air, and water.

Using lentiviral pseudotypes and a cell- culture adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus with a S1/S2 deletion, we show that the polybasic insertion is selected for in lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures but selected against in Vero E6, a cell line used for passaging SARS-CoV-2. The furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a key determinant for transmission We find this selective advantage depends on expression of the cell surface protease, TMPRSS2, that allows virus entry independent of endosomes thus avoiding antiviral IFITM proteins. SARS-CoV-2 has a unique polybasic insertion at the S1/S2 CS, which we demonstrate can be cleaved by furin.

Conclusions Given that live SARS-CoV-2 virions are known to be shed in high concentrations from the nasal cavity of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, the results suggest that those sharing enclosed spaces with infectors for long periods may be at risk of contracting COVID-19 by the aerosol route, even when practicing social distancing. In order to quantify the risk posed by COVID-19 infectors exhaling respiratory aerosols in enclosed spaces, we undertook a computer modelling study to simulate transmission in an office building. ]: dot [@]: at [MHRA]: Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency [JCVI]: Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation [PMC]: Penske Media Corporation [ COVID-19]: coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]: coronavirus disease 2019 [v]: View this template [t]: telephone [e]: email []: You need to accept this checkbox.

And, just as importantly, antigen-based testing is highly specific: unlike its PCR counterpart, the antigen test isnt fooled by faint signals of lingering viral matter outside the period of infectiousness. Fortunately, other attributes of saliva-based antigen testing make this feasible: unlike PCR, it doesnt require trained personnel, specific chemical supplies, or centralized, expensive laboratory instrument; it is less vulnerable to the supply chain bottlenecks that plague PCR-based labs; it returns results in a matter of hours; it costs as little as $1 per test; and it could be as convenient as sucking on a piece of paper. Rapid, saliva-based antigen testing is an essential weapon in the fight to resume many of the activities and reopen many of the venues that comprise what we used to call normal life. It is practical, convenient, cost-effective, and easily scaled.

We identified new targets of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and show that nucleocapsid, open reading frame (ORF)8 and ORF3b elicit the strongest specific antibody responses. We have identified ORF8 antibodies as a major marker of acute, convalescent and long-term antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection because of its immunodominance and specificity, in addition to N protein.

Next, we find that plasma from all 22/24 subjects with anti-trimer IgGs inhibited ACE2-trimer binding to a greater degree than controls, and that the degree of inhibition correlated with anti-trimer IgG levels. This inhibition assay may be broadly useful to quantify the functional antibody response of recovered COVID19 patients or vaccine recipients in a cell-free assay system. Here we present microsphere-based Flow Cytometry assays that quantify both anti-spike IgGs in plasma, and the ability of plasma to inhibit the binding of spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

Conclusions Early suPAR-guided anakinra treatment is associated with decrease of the risk for SRF and restoration of the pro- /anti-inflammatory balance. We investigated if early suPAR (soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor)-guided anakinra treatment could prevent COVID-19-assocated SRF. Anakinra treatment was associated with decrease in SOFA score and in circulating interleukin (IL)-6, sCD163 and sIL2-R; the serum IL-10/IL-6 ratio on day 7 was inversely associated with the change in SOFA score.

Hadassah researchers discovered that the patients who form these fatal clots have an increased level of alpha defensin protein in their blood, explained Dr. Abd Alrauf Higavi, who directs a lab at Hadassah and has been studying blood clots for 30 years. The results show that alpha defensin speeds up blood clot formation, which can cause pulmonary embolism, heart attacks and stroke.

The study also demonstrated that human stem cell-derived heart cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 change their gene expression profile, further confirming that the cells can be actively infected by the virus and activate innate cellular defense mechanisms in an effort to help clear out the virus. A new study shows that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus), can infect heart cells in a lab dish, indicating it may be possible for heart cells in COVID-19 patients to be directly infected by the virus.

Our findings show that endogenous α1-AT restricts SARS-CoV-2 and repurposes α1-AT-based drugs for COVID-19 therapy. To identify factors of the respiratory tract that suppress SARS-CoV-2, we screened a peptide/protein library derived from bronchoalveolar lavage, and identified α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) as specific inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. α1-AT targets the viral spike protein and blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection of human airway epithelium at physiological concentrations.

Young children can potentially be important drivers of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the general population, the authors wrote. A much larger South Korean study recently found that children younger than 10 transmit to others much less often than adults do, while those between the ages of 10 and 19 can spread the virus at least as well as adults do.

In the aggregate, the analysis confirms and extends our previous preliminary finding that transfusion of COVID-19 patients soon after hospitalization with high titer anti-spike protein RBD IgG present in convalescent plasma significantly reduces mortality. Transfusion of convalescent plasma collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 disease has emerged as a promising therapy and has been granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). With respect to altering mortality, our analysis identified an optimal window of 44 hours post-hospitalization for transfusing COVID-19 patients with high titer convalescent plasma. We recently reported results from interim analysis of a propensity-score matched study suggesting that early treatment of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma containing high titer anti-spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG significantly decreases mortality.

Here we report a statistically significant correlation between viral load and disease severity, being high viral load associated with worse clinical prognosis, independently of several previously identified risk factors such as age, sex, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and lung disease (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The data presented here reinforce the viral load as a potential biomarker for predicting disease severity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. It is also an important parameter in viral evolution since it relates to the numbers and types of variant genomes present in a viral population, a potential determinant of disease progression.

In this autopsy series, cardiac replication of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with early death. Understanding both direct and indirect damage caused to the heart and the vascular system by SARS-CoV-2 infection is necessary to identify optimal clinical care strategies. Accordingly, there are several studies reporting a direct effect on heart function of coronaviruses with a pathogenicity similar to that of SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, cardiac insufficiency is more likely to occur in these patients where cardiac function is already compromised by myocardial ischemia [4,5,6, 83, 84].

The vaccine could achieve safety approval in 90 days, he said. Given the urgent global need for a human coronavirus vaccine, we are doing everything we can to accelerate development, MIGAL CEO David Zigdon said. Yes, in a few weeks, if it all works, we would have a vaccine to prevent coronavirus. We are in the middle of this process, and hopefully in a few weeks we will have the vaccine in our hands.

Conclusions Thorough on-site evaluation of commercially available serologic tests for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 remains imperative for laboratories. The potentially impaired sensitivity of the Siemens COV2G necessitates a switch to the companys newly filed SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (sCOVG) for follow-up studies. ROC curve analyses suggest a lowering of the cut-off index for the Siemens COV2G assay. Finally, the combination of two anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is feasible when considering borderline reactive results.

Clearly we need more information about these patients, such as were there underlying medical conditions or a change in circumstances that might have allowed the virus to escape immune control? However, the report reinforces the fact that we have to investigate all such findings really thoroughly and report such information if we are to make the best decisions based on sound scientific evidence. She has a prolonged excretion of virus from her initial infection and tests were either not done or were not done sufficiently well or enough to confirm clearance. Although coronaviruses generally cause short- term self-limiting infections which are cleared, there is some evidence in the scientific literature for persistent infections of animal coronaviruses (mainly in bats). This highlights the need for more research into the biology of the new coronavirus, it is very much early days in our efforts to understand it. On case in Japan: Prof Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, University of East Anglia (UEA), said: Regarding this reported case: There is so much we do not know about this case to give a properly informed opinion.

If it is possible to block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) blocker that can effectively block the IL-6 signal transduction pathway and thus is likely to become an effective drug for patients with severe COVID-19.

We then showed that dACE2 , but not ACE2 , is induced in various human cell types by IFNs and viruses; this information is important to consider for future therapeutic strategies and understanding COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes. Our discovery of dACE2 , a truncated version of ACE2 , demonstrates that it is dACE2 and not ACE2 that is induced by IFNs and viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

If this high rate of risk is confirmed,  then the crisis of COVID-19 will not abate but will instead shift to a new de novo incidence of heart failure and other chronic cardiovascular complications, they wrote. These are two studies that both suggest that being infected with Covid-19 carries a high likelihood of having some involvement of the heart. The connection between Covid-19 and blood clots emerged later, after doctors began connecting the pulmonary aneurysms, strokes, and heart attacks they were seeing to the virus.

In addition, frequent mask use in public venues, frequent hand washing, and disinfecting the living quarters were significant protective factors (OR 0.36 to 0.58). The three public health variables--frequently wearing a mask in public places (adjusted OR = 0.36, p < 0.001), washing hands >10 times a day (adjusted OR = 0.44, p = 0.008), and disinfecting the living quarters thoroughly (adjusted OR = 0.36, p < 0.001)--remained significant protective factors. A number of protective factors were related to relevant public health measures, including the frequency of using a face mask in public venues, the frequency of washing hands each day, and disinfection of living quarters thoroughly during the same period.

Chloroquine protects mice against lethal sepsis and inhibits HMGB1 release (A) The cecal Figure 3. Here, we show that chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, prevents lethality in mice with established endotoxemia or sepsis. The protective effects of chloroquine were mediated through inhibition of HMGB1 release in macrophages, monocytes, and endothelial cells, thereby preventing its cytokine-like activities. Chloroquine protects mice against lethal sepsis and inhibits HMGB1 release (A) The cecal ligation and puncture technique was used to induce intraabdominal sepsis in mice (n = 20 per group).

Chloroquine protects mice against lethal sepsis and inhibits HMGB1 release (A) The cecal ligation and puncture technique was used to induce intraabdominal sepsis in mice (n = 20 per group).
Conclusions Based on these findings, we speculated that 2019-nCov could effectively invade oral mucosal cells though two possible routes: binding to the ACE2 receptor and fusion with cell membrane activated by FURIN protease. Our results indicated that oral mucosa tissues are susceptible to 2019-nCov, which provides valuable information for virus-prevention strategy in clinical care as well as daily life. Results The bioinformatics results indicated the differential expression of ACE2 and FURIN on epithelial cells of different oral mucosal tissues and the proportion of FURIN-positive cells was obviously higher than that of ACE2-positive cells. The S-glycoprotein, which recognized as the key factor for the entry of 2019-nCov into the cell, contains two functional domains: an ACE2 receptor binding domain and a second domain necessary for fusion of the coronavirus and cell membranes.

A study adds to evidence that it could be through odor-sensing cells in the nose. Because the cells lining the nose may prove to be a key entry point for SARS- CoV-2, Lane says there may be ways to target those particular cells with topical antiviral drugs or other therapies directly to that area.

Randy Hillier, Independent Ontario MPP for Lanark, Frontenac & Kingston, expressed concern over the Federal Quarantine/Isolation sites in the provincial question period late this week. The expansion of isolation/quarantine camps in Canada is something of concern and the Ontario government must know about it, so why won't they tell the people of Ontario? So your government must be in negotiations and aware of these plans to potentially detain and isolate citizens and residents of our country and our province, so speaker, to the Premier, where will these camps be built, how many people will be detained, and for what reason, for what reasons can people be kept in these isolation camps, and I'd like to have the Premier assure the people of Ontario, said Hillier, whose microphone was cut off before he could finish.

This order ceases operations of cruise ships in waters in which the United States may exert jurisdiction and requires that they develop a comprehensive, detailed operational plan approved by CDC and the USCG to address the COVID-19 pandemic through maritime focused solutions, including a fully implementable response plan with limited reliance on state, local, and federal government support. Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) voluntarily suspended cruise ship operations in March in conjunction with the earlier No Sail Order issued March 14. The CDC, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of Homeland Security have been working with the industry to determine the most appropriate public health strategy to limit the impact of COVID-19 at cruise ship ports of entry in the United States. The No Sail Order reinforces the strong action by President Donald J. Trump and the White House Coronavirus Task Force to combat the spread of COVID-19 in the United States.

Here, we report that afucosylated IgG which are of minor abundance in humans (6% of total IgG) are specifically formed against surface epitopes of enveloped viruses after natural infections or immunization with attenuated viruses, while protein subunit immunization does not elicit this low fucose response. In the case of COVID-19, the critically ill show aggravated afucosylated-IgG responses against the viral spike protein. Our findings indicate antibody glycosylation as a potential factor in inflammation and protection in enveloped virus infections including COVID-19.

Even less efficient cloth masks could also slow the spread if worn consistently, Kumar added. The performance of face masks worn for many hours, such as by health care or other essential workers, impact how effective overall mask wearing can be, the researchers added. Singapore : The COVID-19 pandemic could end if at least 70% of the people wore face masks in public consistently, according to a review of studies which suggests that the type of material used and the duration of mask use play key roles in their effectiveness. According to the scientists, one key aspect of face mask function involves the size of fluid droplets expelled from the nose and mouth when a person talks, sings, sneezes, coughs, or even simply breathes.

The results also revealed that men are more likely to die of the infection than are women  the gap increasing with age. Gender is also a strong risk factor, with men almost twice more likely to die from the coronavirus than women. 2 The immune system might also explain the much higher risk of older people dying from the virus. Trends in coronavirus deaths by age have been clear since early in the pandemic.

This mirrors the well studied exponential decline of both thymus volume and T-cell production, which halve every 16 years. The strikingly simple inverse relationship between COVID-19 risk and thymic T-cell output reported here begs a mechanistic understanding and suggests that T-cell based therapies may be a promising target. In addition, incidence of severe disease and mortality due to COVID-19 are both higher in men, consistent with the degree to which thymic involution (and the decrease in T-cell production with age) is more severe in men compared to women.

They then demonstrated that sofosbuvir and four other nucleotide analogues (the active triphosphate forms of the HIV inhibitors Alovudine, Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide, and Emtricitabine) also inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase with different levels of efficiency. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, six exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction, two showed delayed termination, and three did not terminate the polymerase reaction. In an earlier set of experiments testing the properties of the polymerase of the coronavirus that causes SARS, the researchers found that the triphosphate of sofosbuvir was able to terminate the virus polymerase reaction. Researchers at Columbia Engineering and the University of Wisconsin-Madison have identified a library of molecules that shut down the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase reaction, a key step that establishes the potential of these molecules as lead compounds to be further modified for the development of COVID-19 therapeutics.

Therefore, we evaluated the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Longitudinal high-throughput TCR repertoire profiling reveals the dynamics of T-cell memory formation after mild COVID-19 infection. Results: We describe two patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) aged 34 and 26 years with complete absence of B cells from peripheral blood who developed COVID-19, as diagnosed by SARS-CoV-2 detection by nasopharyngeal swab, while receiving immunoglobulin infusions.

Cite this: COVID-19 Anticoagulation Trials 'Paused' for Futility, Safety - Medscape - Dec 22, 2020. Therapeutic dosing was safe in this moderately ill COVID-19 population, unlike in the critically ill population for which the trials halted the full-dose strategy after seeing signals of harm. All three trials have paused enrollment of critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit support for whom therapeutic doses of anticoagulation drugs did not reduce the need for organ support, the NHLBI statement notes. Informed by the deliberations of the data safety monitoring boards of these trials, all of the trial sites have paused enrollment of the most critically ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Our study serves as a publicly available single-cell atlas of SARS-CoV-2 related entry factors and interaction partners in human and mouse brain endothelial- and perivascular cells, which can be employed for future studies in clinical samples of COVID-19 patients. We observed a distinct expression pattern of the cathepsins B (CTSB) and -L (CTSL) - which are able to substitute for the ACE2 co-receptor TMPRSS2 - in the human vasculature with CTSB being mainly expressed in the brain vasculature and CTSL predominantly in the peripheral vasculature, and these observations were confirmed at the protein level in the Human Protein Atlas and using immunofluorescence stainings. This expression pattern of SARS-CoV-2 viral-entry associated proteases and SARS-CoV-2 interaction partners was also present in endothelial cells and microglia in the fetal brain, suggesting a developmentally established SARS-CoV-2 entry machinery in the human vasculature. At both the adult and fetal stages, we detected a distinct pattern of SARS-CoV-2 entry associated genes transcripts in brain vascular endothelial cells and microglia, providing a potential explanation for an inflammatory response in the brain endothelium upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The effectiveness of moral messages on public health behavioral intentions during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the current context, this appears to be the case with negative emotions being protective (i.e., encouraging of public health-promoting behaviors) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in risk perception and protective behavior during the first week of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. That is, for most individuals, the anxious responses being assessed by the FCV-19 may represent a normal and adaptive response to a real and present danger that one cannot fight or flee from, within the environment (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic).

Following immunizations with MVA/S or MVA/S1, both spike protein recombinants induced strong IgG antibodies to purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These results demonstrate MVA/S is a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The MVA/S induced a robust antibody response to purified RBD, S1 and S2 whereas MVA/S1 induced an antibody response to the S1 region outside of the RBD region.

The mutation changes an arginine residue to a histidine residue at position 364 in the S1 subunit of the viral spike protein. The mutation is located at the surface of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the main surface structure the virus uses to gain entry to host cells. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from late April in Stockholm, Sweden reveal a novel mutation in the spike protein. Tatiany Soratto and colleagues from the Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, and the Federal University of Santa Catarina, in Brazil, say it is possible the unknown mutation could affect the ability of the virus to bind to host cells.

Heart palpitations have been reported to be the main presenting symptom of COVID-19 in patients without a fever or cough82. Patients with COVID-19 infection can present with symptoms mimicking CV events, including chest pain, dyspnoea, and shock, even in the absence of cardiac injury. An autopsy of a patient with COVID-19 and ARDS who died of a sudden cardiac arrest showed no evidence of myocardial structural involvement, suggesting that COVID-19 did not directly impair the heart57. These observations suggest that COVID-19 can cause ACS even in the absence of substantial systemic inflammation.

We report that the SARS-CoV-2 viroporin encoded by ORF3a activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, the most promiscuous of known inflammasomes. In a pared-down system, we investigate the influence of ORF3a, an essential SARS-CoV-2 protein, on the inflammatory machinery and find that it activates NLRP3, the most prominent inflammasome by causing potassium loss across the cell membrane.

ACE2 expression correlated with increased macrophage abundance in some tumors, while TMPRSS2 was strongly associated with epithelial cells. Results Matched normal tissues generally display higher ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression compared with cancer, with normal and tumor from digestive organs expressing the highest levels. The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was significantly higher in normal tissues relative to tumors (figure 1C). By the search for network database and re-analysis of pubic data, we found the level of ACE2 expression in adipose tissue was higher than that in lung tissue, which indicated the adipose tissue might be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 as well; the levels of ACE2 expressed by adipocytes and adipose progenitor cells were similar between non-obese individuals and obese individuals, but obese individuals have more adiposes so as to increase the number of ACE2-expressing cells; the expression of ACE2 in tumor tissues posed by five different types of cancers increased significantly compared with that in adjacent tissues.

In summary, lack of immune homology between SARS-CoV-2 and VPD pathogens suggests that childhood immunization history (i.e., BCG vaccination or others) does not provide protection from SARS-CoV-2 through adaptive cross-immunity. Little to no immune homology between SARS-CoV-2 and VPD pathogens: insignificant aligned protein sequences, unmapped immune epitopes, or matched N-glycosylation sites with different glycosylation potentials and positions. BCG vaccination is unlikely to confer SARS-CoV-2 protection through adaptive cross-immunity.

Understanding T cell-responses in the context of clinical severity might serve as foundation to overcome the lack of effective anti-viral immune response in severely affected COVID-19 patients and can offer prognostic value as biomarker for disease outcome and control. Follow up samples revealed a marked increase in effector T cells and memory subsets in convalescing but not in non-convalescing patients.

Our results reveal that specific sulfated polysaccharides bind tightly to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, which suggests that they can act as decoys to interfere with S-protein binding to the heparan sulfate co-receptor in host tissues3,11, inhibiting viral infection. Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2.5 × 103 with varying dosages of polysaccharide to confirm antiviral activity.

Researchers estimated a risk for COVID-19 diagnosis of 30.0 per 10.000 and 3.7 per 10,000 for death among HIV-positive people receiving ART. Risk of COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization was lower for people living with HIV receiving Truvada, or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC), compared with those on other ART regimens, as well as the Spanish population ages 20-79, reported Julia del Amo, MD, PhD, of the National Plan Against AIDS in Madrid, and colleagues. Moreover, the risk of COVID-19 diagnosis was not higher among people living with HIV on ART than the general population of Spain, they wrote in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The lack of increased risk for serious COVID-19 among HIV-positive persons might be the result of their use of ART, they wrote, adding ART was proposed as a protective factor against SARS in 2003, but there were too few cases to draw meaningful conclusions about its role.

Our study identified TRIM28 as a novel regulator of ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. The expression level of ACE2 potentially determine the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19, it is thus of importance to understand the regulatory mechanism of ACE2 expression. This study showed that knockdown of TRIM28 induces ACE2 expression and increases pseudotyped SARS- CoV-2 cell entry of A549 cells and primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (PAEpiCs).

We establish that in hamsters a dysregulated innate immune response is a driving force behind SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, in which in particular signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 2 (STAT2)-dependent type I and III IFN signaling plays a dual role: (i) restricting infection and dissemination on one hand but (ii) driving development of severe lung disease on the other. Together, these data suggest that STAT2 is critical for keeping virus replication and production of infectious progeny in the lungs down, as well as for restricting systemic SARS-CoV-2 spread and suppressing viral replication outside of the lung compartment. By using unique KO hamster lines, we demonstrated that STAT2 plays a critical role in mediating antiviral responses and restricting systemic dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 (see Fig.

What happened: A medical distribution company called Bodysphere said in a press release that the FDA had granted an emergency use authorization that could allow patients to get a diagnosis in only about two minutes. Due to a press release being issued about a two-minute COVID-19 test being granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA, the story was shared with MPO readers. In its press release Tuesday, Bodysphere claimed its test had already been used successfully in several states. It was published a day after President Donald Trump touted the FDA's approval last week of a swab test that can detect the illness in five minutes.

The extension would leave the federal recommendations in place beyond Easter, April 12, by which time Trump had hoped the country and its economy could start to rev up again. Trumps decision to extend the guidelines reflected a recognition that the struggle will take place over the longer haul and the risk of deaths spiraling into the hundreds of thousands is real.

Dr Leung Chi-chiu, chairman of the advisory committee on communicable diseases at the Hong Kong Medical Association, said the universal use of masks was vital in reducing the spread of the virus. Universal masking, as a package of anti-epidemic measures, including greater social distancing and hand hygiene, has been instrumental in keeping Covid-19 in check, said infectious diseases expert Professor David Hui Shu-cheong of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Wearing masks in public has been ingrained in Hongkongers' collective psyche since the deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2003, and experts now believe the habit helped the city of 7.4 million keep its Covid-19 numbers down to 845, with four deaths as of Friday.

In a time of pandemic, having evacuated federal responsibility, the White House is functionally waging a war against state leadership and the initiative of local hospitals to secure what they need to provide sufficient treatment. Over the last few weeks, it has started to appear as though, in addition to abandoning the states to their own devices in a time of national emergency, the federal government has effectively erected a blockade -- like that which the Union used to choke off the supply chains of the Confederacy during the Civil War -- to prevent delivery of critical medical equipment to states desperately in need.

We previously described REGN-COV2, a cocktail of two potent neutralizing antibodies (REGN10987+REGN10933) targeting non-overlapping epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In this report, we evaluate the in vivo efficacy of this antibody cocktail in both rhesus macaques and golden hamsters and demonstrate that REGN-COV-2 can greatly reduce virus load in lower and upper airway and decrease virus induced pathological sequalae when administered prophylactically or therapeutically. Our results provide evidence of the therapeutic potential of this antibody cocktail.

A new clinical blood test will start being conducted at the UW Medicine Virology Lab, beginning next week, to check people for past infection with SARS-CoV-2. It could spot a past infection with this new coronavirus and not confuse it with other viruses, including other respiratory coronaviruses. The test looks for the presence of an antibody, called IgG, which people produce in fending off the pandemic coronavirus.

The health secretary told the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) and Public Health England to create guidelines for the use of the sunshine nutrient two weeks ago, before it was reported that the government was planning to give four months worth of vitamin D supplements to more than 2 million vulnerable and elderly people, following the lead of Scotland. In a statement, a spokesperson for Nice, which sets NHS clinical guidelines, told the Guardian: Nice and PHE received a formal request to produce recommendations on vitamin D for prevention and treatment of Covid from the secretary of state for health and social care, Matt Hancock, on October 29. The move comes after the government began considering giving vitamin D supplements to elderly people and those who are shielding as the UK enters winter. Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian Vitamin D has moved a step closer to being used as a potential way to prevent and treat coronavirus after Matt Hancock asked government health advisers to produce new guidelines on its use.

Ludvigsson, J. F. Systematic review of COVID19 in children shows milder cases and a better prognosis than adults. Because children have lower susceptibility and exhibit more mildly symptomatic cases for COVID-19, school closures were slightly more effective at reducing transmission of COVID-19 when the infectiousness of subclinical infections was assumed to be high.

By analyzing several thousand plasma proteins in 306 COVID-19 patients and 78 symptomatic controls over serial timepoints using two complementary approaches, we uncover COVID-19 host immune and non-immune proteins not previously linked to this disease. Integration of plasma proteomics with nine published scRNAseq datasets shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulates monocyte/macrophage, plasmablast, and T cell effector proteins.

Results Compared to healthy controls, the overall ACE2 (receptor of SARS- CoV-2) expression was significantly higher in lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients, in particular in ciliated cell, club cell and basal cell. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the community interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells: the interaction between epithelial cells with macrophage, T and NK cell was stronger, but their interaction with neutrophils was lost in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection activates pro-inflammatory signaling in lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and causes dysregulation of immune response to release more pro-inflammatory cytokines.

These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children and adults who develop severe disease, with implications for optimizing treatments based on symptom and age. Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing activity compared to both COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. Here, we show distinct antibody (Ab) responses in children with MIS-C compared to adults with severe COVID-19 causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those who recovered from mild disease. There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while the COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs.

Here we show that the adenovirus- vector-based vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, which encodes the spike protein of SARS- CoV-2, is immunogenic in mice and elicites a robust humoral and cell-mediated response. Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (using either a prime-only or a prime-boost regimen) induced a balanced humoral and cellular immune response of type-1 and type-2 T helper cells in rhesus macaques.

As for the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19, We need to figure out the mechanism and understand it at the molecular level to be able to say for sure how this is occurring -- that this is really the O blood type and not something that kind of tracks with O blood type, Adalja said. Here's how to find out yours A separate study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in June, found genetic data in some Covid-19 patients and healthy people suggesting that those with Type A blood had a higher risk of becoming infected, and those with type O blood were at a lower risk.

This structure highlights the ability of neutron protein crystallography for experimentally determining protonation states at near- physiological temperature  the critical information for structure-assisted and computational drug design. A long-standing question in the field has been what the protonation states of the ionizable residues in the substrate-binding active site cavity are. The neutron structure also identified the protonation states of other amino acid residues, mapping electrical charges and intricate hydrogen bonding networks in the SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro active site cavity and dimer interface. Here, we present the room- temperature neutron structure of 3CL Mpro from SARS-CoV-2, which allows direct determination of hydrogen atom positions and, hence, protonation states.

In combination with certain previous findings on COVID-19 antibodies, the researchers concluded that their results might indicate the risks of using COVID-19 'immunity passports' and support the prolongation of public health interventions, including social distancing, hygiene, isolation of high-risk groups and widespread testing. Decreases in the neutralizing antibodies were seen in 81% (30/37) of the asymptomatic group and 62% (23/37) of the symptomatic group. Antibody levels dropped by 71.1% in asymptomatic patients and 76.2% in the symptomatic group. The median decreases in antibody level were 8.3% in the asymptomatic group and 11.7% in the symptomatic patients.

The benefit of the Pneumask as PPE is that it is reusable for longer periods than typical disposable N95 respirators, as the snorkel mask can withstand rigorous decontamination protocols (that are standard to regular elastomeric respirators). Key points Full-face snorkel masks are adapted for use as Personal Protective Equipment during the COVID-19 crisis, using a custom adapter that facilitates the attachment of inline medical-grade respiratory filters or NIOSH industrial respirator filters. These tests found the Pneumask capable of forming a seal that exceeds the standards required for half-face respirators or N95 respirators.

Coupled with a rapid time-to-result, low cost, and scalability, antigen-based testing should facilitate effective implementation of testing and public health interventions that will better contain COVID-19. The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 antigen and SARS-CoV-2 culture represents a significant advancement in determining the risk for potential transmissibility beyond that which can be achieved by detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA.

Existing Lilly medicines are now being studied to understand their potential in treating complications of COVID-19, and the company is collaborating with two partner companies to discover novel antibody treatments for COVID-19. These interim data from the BLAZE-1 trial suggest that LY-CoV555, an antibody specifically directed against SARS-CoV-2, has a direct antiviral effect and may reduce COVID-related hospitalizations, said Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., Lilly's chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories. Lilly intends to test both single antibody therapy as well as combinations of antibodies (sometimes known as antibody cocktails) as potential therapeutics for COVID-19. LY-CoV555 emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lilly has successfully completed enrollment and primary safety assessments of LY-CoV555 in a Phase 1 study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (NCT04411628) and long-term follow-up is ongoing.

According to Moderna, the vaccine was developed within 42 days of the company obtaining genetic information on the coronavirus. The collaboration across Moderna, with NIAID, and with CEPI has allowed us to deliver a clinical batch in 42 days from sequence identification, said Juan Andres, Chief Technical Operations and Quality Officer at Moderna. The potential vaccine -- developed by Moderna, a small Massachusetts biotech company -- has had a speedy development: Moderna went from sequencing the virus' genetic information to shipping a vaccine candidate to US health officials in 42 days. Moderna developed the vaccine in what Juan Andres, Modernas chief technical operations and quality officer, called record speed  just 42 days. It took 42 days for Moderna to move from sequencing the virus to shipping a vaccine candidate to NIH officials.

To explore the direct involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS in physiologically relevant models, the research team assessed SARS-CoV-2 infection in human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), neurospheres and brain organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Overall, our study provides the first evidence of direct SARS-CoV-2 infection in human brain organoids, which contributes to our understanding of the pathogenesis of neurological complications in COVID-19, said Prof. HUANG Jiandong from HKU, who led the study. Extensive protein expression and infectious viral particles were detected in neurospheres and brain organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2, which suggested SARS-CoV-2 could productively infect the human brain. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection in 3D human brain organoids was localised to TUJ1 (neuronal marker) - and NESTIN (NPC marker)-positive cells, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 could directly target cortical neurons and NPCs. The research team suggested that chronic and long-term consequences of SARS- CoV-2 infection of the CNS should be closely monitored.

Consequently, the authors suggest that the safety and potential effects of antihypertension therapy with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19 should be carefully considered. Given that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the safety and potential effects of antihypertension therapy with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19 should be carefully considered. Given that SARS-CoV-2 has a similar structure to SARS-CoV, this novel virus might also cause chronic damage to the cardiovascular system, and attention should be given to cardiovascular protection during treatment for COVID-19. Consequently, the authors suggest that the safety and potential effects of antihypertension therapy with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19 should be carefully considered.

One-sentence summary A dimeric form of a SARS-CoV-2-derived lipopeptide is a potent inhibitor of fusion and infection in vitro and transmission in vivo. We have designed a dimeric lipopeptide fusion inhibitor that blocks this critical first step of infection for emerging coronaviruses and document that it completely prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in ferrets. Daily intranasal administration to ferrets completely prevented SARS-CoV-2 direct-contact transmission during 24-hour co- housing with infected animals, under stringent conditions that resulted in infection of 100% of untreated animals.

We conclude that the major immunologic abnormality in COVID-19 is a profound defect in host immunity and not hypercytokinemia-induced organ injury. Cytokine profile in plasma of severe COVID-19 does not differ from ARDS and sepsis. Severe immunosuppression and not a cytokine storm characterizes COVID-19 infections. The results from the present study strongly suggest that the primary endotype of COVID-19 is one of immunosuppression rather than hyperinflammation.

Autophagy modulators have emerged as potential therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2 but recent clinical setbacks underline the urgent need for better understanding the mechanism of viral subversion of autophagy. In conclusion, our study identified a new mechanism by which PLpro of betacoronaviruses induces viral pathogenesis by targeting cellular autophagic pathway (Word count=250) IMPORTANCE The recent COVID-19 global pandemic alongside the 2003 SARS and 2012 MERS outbreaks underscore an urgent need to better understand betacoronaviruses as pathogens that pose global challenge to human health. To investigate whether virus-encoded proteases target this protein, we conducted in vitro and cellular cleavage assays and identified ULK1 as a novel bona fide substrate of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). Using murine hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59) as a model betacoronavirus , time-course infections revealed a significant loss in the protein level of ULK1, a canonical autophagy regulating serine-threonine kinase, and the concomitant appearance of a possible cleavage fragment. Consistent with this, over-expression of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is sufficient to impair starvation-induced canonical autophagy and disrupt formation of ULK1-ATG13 complex.

The weekly percent positive of SARS-CoV-2 during April 17, 2020 to July 10, 2020 showed a significant negative correlation with the sunlight UV radiation dose in census regions 1 and 2 of the U.S. while no statistical significance in the other regions. UVC can inactivate coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Additionally, sunlight UV radiation also showed some negative effects with respect to the early SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In this study, Spearman and Kendall rank correlation analysis tests were used to analyze the correlation between the average percent positive of five human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, CoVHKU1, CoVNL63, CoVOC43, and CoV229E) in the U.S. and the corresponding sunlight UV radiation dose The results indicated that the monthly average percent positive of four common coronaviruses was significantly negatively correlated with the sunlight UV radiation dose.

In vitro , the Spike escape variant conferred decreased sensitivity to multiple units of convalescent plasma/sera from different recovered patients, whilst maintaining infectivity similar to wild type. These data reveal strong positive selection on SARS-CoV-2 during convalescent plasma therapy and identify the combination of Spike mutations D796H and Δ H69/ Δ V70 as a broad antibody resistance mechanism against commonly occurring antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.

According to the Liverpool data, some of the riskiest drug-drug interactions are between experimental Covid-19 treatments and heart-related medications, including antiarrhythmics, beta blockers, anti-coagulants, calcium channel blockers, some hypertensives, and lipid-lowering statins. On the other hand, the Liverpool interactions group has provided prescribing resources where they categorized the interactions of experimental COVID-19 antiviral therapies as contraindicated medications, potential interactions requiring dose adjustment/close monitoring, potential interactions of weak intensity or no clinically significant interactions (University of Liverpool, 2020).

These data highlight the value of Organ Chip technology as a more stringent and physiologically relevant platform for drug repurposing, and suggest that amodiaquine should be considered for future clinical testing. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Airway Chips were used to assess the inhibitory activities of approved drugs that showed inhibition in traditional cell culture assays only to find that most failed when tested in the Organ Chip platform. We provide a first demonstration of drug repurposing by using oseltamivir in influenza A virus-infected organ chip cultures and show that co-administration of the approved anticoagulant drug, nafamostat, can double oseltamivirs therapeutic time window. Here we show that human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture devices lined by highly differentiated human primary lung airway epithelium and endothelium can be used to model virus entry, replication, strain- dependent virulence, host cytokine production, and recruitment of circulating immune cells in response to infection by respiratory viruses with great pandemic potential.

Pfizer has said it will be able to supply up to 25 million doses before the end of the year, and 100 million total vaccines by March.Credit...Justin Tallis/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images By Katie Thomas, Sharon LaFraniere, Noah Weiland, Abby Goodnough and Maggie Haberman Published Dec. 11, 2020Updated Jan. 8, 2021 The Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizers Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use on Friday, clearing the way for millions of highly vulnerable people to begin receiving the vaccine within days. Pfizer has a deal with the U.S. government to supply 100 million doses of the vaccine by next March. The authorization set off a complicated coordination effort from Pfizer, private shipping companies, state and local health officials, the military, hospitals and pharmacy chains to get the first weeks batch of about three million doses to health care workers and nursing home residents as quickly as possible, all while keeping the vaccine at ultracold temperatures. McKesson Corporation, a giant medical supplier, is sending kits of syringes, alcohol pads, face shields and other supplies to the same sites, where they will meet up with the vaccines that Pfizer is shipping in special boxes, packed with dry ice, designed to keep them at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit.

Moreover, Northern Hemisphere countries face a crucial window of opportunity: if contagion-containing policy interventions can dramatically reduce COVID-19 cases with the aid of the approaching warmer months, it may be possible to avoid a second wave of COVID-19 next winter. Using constructions of expected seasonal temperatures, we project that changing temperatures between March 2020 and July 2020 will cause COVID-19 transmission to fall by 43% on average for Northern Hemisphere countries and to rise by 71% on average for Southern Hemisphere countries.

Politico was the first to report on the eight additional sailors. They had all tested negative twice before being allowed back on board before this latest incident of testing positive again for the virus. This latest development is in addition to five other sailors aboard the ship that CNN reported earlier this week who had also again tested positive after being thought to be clear of the virus. (CNN)Eight additional sailors aboard the coronavirus-stricken carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt have now tested positive for the virus according to a defense official.

DNA vaccines encoding antigens presented on EVs efficiently induce T-cell responses and EV-based vaccines containing the Spike (S) proteins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) are highly immunogenic in mice. Immunizations with a two component CoVEVax vaccine, comprising DNA vector (DNAS-EV) primes, allowing in situ production of Spike harbouring EVs, and a boost using S-EVs produced in mammalian cells, trigger potent neutralizing and cellular responses in mice, in the absence of any adjuvants.

Summary In clinical practice the protective effects of ARBs and ACEIs are thought to be associated with an increase in ACE2 expression and their inhibition of the overactive renin-angiotensin system through reduction of Ang II effects. Therefore, induction of the downstream pathway of ACE2, by activating the ACE2/Ang1-7/MAS axis may prove a useful strategy in preventing lung and cardiovascular damage associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections.

And the virus seems to activate the complement system, a defence mechanism that sparks clotting. One possibility is that SARS- CoV-2 is directly attacking the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels. They might have a genetic predisposition to clotting, or be taking medications that increase the risk.

Significant increases in regulatory T cell frequencies, TIM-3 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells, as well as PD-L1 expression on B cells were also observed in CI, while the cytotoxic potential of T cells and NKT-like cells, defined by GzmB expression, was significantly diminished. Concomitant with the decrease in NKT-like cells, an increase in the percentage of Annexin V and 7-AAD double positive NKT-like cells was detected, suggesting that the reduction in NKT-like cells results from cell death months after recovery.

Upon infection, an individuals immune state, possibly impacted by pre-existing antibodies to other coronaviruses (among other mechanisms), may cause harm through immunopathogenesis, and the literature on this topic primarily consists of in vitro experiments. Antibody against nucleocapsid protein predicts susceptibility to human coronavirus infection.

Due to the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection to host cells and its pathogenesis remain largely unclear, there are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. In the current study, we have reported that SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins and some anti-COVID-19 drugs currently used are able to induce lytic reactivation of Kaposis sarcoma- associated herpesvirus (KSHV), one of major human oncogenic viruses through manipulation of intracellular signaling pathways.

Using authentic SARS-CoV-2 isogenic variants, we show the role of the D614G substitution in enhancing viral infectivity in immortalized cell lines, growth, and fitness in primary human airway epithelial cells and hamsters, yet it marginally alters viral pathogenesis in hamster and hACE2 mouse models. 1 SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant shows enhanced infectivity in immortalized cell lines and replication fitness in upper human respiratory epithelia compared with the ancestral WT virus. SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses encoding the D614G substitution were reported to exhibit increased infectivity in continuous cell lines and increased sensitivity to neutralization ( 4, 5).

The coffee analogy is one used by Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, and it's meant to describe the functional difference between two approaches to rapid testing for the virus. Espresso coffee tests are reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests or deluxe antigen tests, and several manufacturers, like Mesa Biotech, Quidel and Becton, Dickinson, have already been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

During the 2003 SARS crisis, at Amoy Gardens the U-shaped pipe traps connecting to the floor drains were empty of water, allowing droplets containing viruses to come down the pipes from other apartments to collect in the U-bend. The bathrooms in the apartments had floor drains for cleaning, and when the U-shaped traps beneath these drains dried out, aerosolized SARS virus from the sick resident reached apartments through an air shaft. In 2003, during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS (which is also caused by a coronavirus) officials found that the virus was likely transmitted in a Hong Kong apartment tower called Amoy Gardens through faulty plumbing, according to the World Health Organization. The case echoes a 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that spread through the pipes of a Hong Kong apartment buildingand some worry that transmission via toilets might have contributed to the COVID-19 outbreak that shut down New York City early in the pandemic.

Findings, published in JAMA Pediatrics, point to the possibility that the youngest children transmit the virus as much as other age groups. Our study was not designed to prove that younger children spread COVID-19 as much as adults, but it is a possibility, says Dr. Heald-Sargent. The ability of younger children to spread COVID-19 may have been under-recognized given the rapid and sustained closure of schools and daycare during the pandemic. We found that children under 5 with COVID-19 have a higher viral load than older children and adults, which may suggest greater transmission, as we see with respiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV, says lead author Taylor Heald-Sargent, MD, PhD, pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Lurie Children's and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

Overall, the majority of patients had robust adaptive immune responses, regardless of disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cell responses were clear and quantifiable in 90% of HLA-A2+ individuals. We investigated the breadth and potency of antibody-, and T-cell immune responses, in 203 recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who presented with asymptomatic to severe infections. These data support the possibility of achieving protective immunity through natural infection and bode well for the prospects of inducing immunological memory through vaccination. To understand the immunological signature of SARS-CoV-2 infections and aid the search for treatments and vaccines, comprehensive characterization of adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed.
Overall, the majority of patients had robust adaptive immune responses, regardless of disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cell responses were clear and quantifiable in 90% of HLA-A2+ individuals.

Ivermectin inhibits Impα/β1- but not Impβ1-dependent nuclear import, whereas mifepristone specifically inhibits IN Figure 1. Importantly, we establish for the first time that ivermectin has potent antiviral activity towards both HIV-1 and dengue virus, both of which are strongly reliant on importin α/β nuclear import, with respect to the HIV-1 integrase and NS5 (non-structural protein 5) polymerase proteins respectively. Ivermectin can inhibit HIV-1 and Figure 3.

Enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary B cells by COVID-19 patient plasma. These findings suggest that the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity-enhancing site could be considered as a possible exacerbating factors for COVID-19 and that a spike protein lacking such antibody epitopes may be required for safe vaccine development, especially for individuals with pre-existing enhancing antibodies. COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b1 elicits human antibody and TH1 T-cell responses. Here we reported the observation of in vitro ADE of SARS-CoV-2 entry into FcγRII receptor-bearing cells by plasma and antibodies from patients who recovered from COVID-19. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19.

Its miraculous. Then, once pandemics end, often there is a period in which people seek out extensive social interaction, and which Christakis predicts will be a second roaring 20s just as after the 1918 flu pandemic. He projects that the coronavirus pandemic will be no different, with the world experiencing an economic and social revival rivaling that which followed the 1918 flu pandemic by the year 2024. Dr Nicholas Christakis, a social epidemiologist who specializes in behavior patterns, put forward his prediction for life after the pandemic in his new book Apollo's Arrow: The Profound and Enduring Impact of Coronavirus on the Way We Live.

It is conceivable that vitamin D adequacy denies the virus easy footholds and thereby slows spreading of the contagion. This has been thought to decrease the amount of the 7-dehydrocholesterol precursor available for conversion to vitamin D and 25(OH)D level declines accordingly in advanced age. In the case of the current COVID-19 pandemic, vitamin D deficiency may provide the virus with an unguarded opening to spread from deficient to deficient individual when there are just too many of them. Editorial: low population mortality from COVID-19 in countries South of latitude 35 degrees North supports vitamin D as a factor determining severity.

Autoclaving and microwave treatment for as little as 20 sec destroyed the infectivity of all four viruses. Microwave treatment appears to be a satisfactory method of inactivating virus while preserving nucleic acid for PCR identification. However, both IBV and APV could be detected by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR after autoclaving and as long as 5 min microwave treatment (Newcastle disease virus and avian influenza viruses were not tested).

Through experimental co-infection of IAV with either pseudotyped or SARS-CoV-2 live virus, we found that IAV pre-infection significantly promoted the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range of cell types. IAV promotes SARS-CoV-2 virus infectivity. The unique feature for IAV to augment SARS-CoV-2 infectivity indicates that the influenza virus is the key pathogen of prevention and control during the current coronavirus pandemic.

PMID: 33225745 Cultural orientation, power, belief in conspiracy theories, and intentions to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Keywords: COVID-19; conspiracy theories; longitudinal; social distancing. Conclusions: Our findings show that COVID-19 conspiracy theories pose a significant threat to public health as they may reduce adherence to social distancing measures. Results: Multivariate growth curve analyses showed that, although conspiracy beliefs decreased and social distancing increased over time, people holding more conspiracy beliefs at the beginning of the pandemic showed the lowest increase in social distancing. Moreover, cross-lagged analyses demonstrated that people who reported more conspiracy beliefs at any wave tended to report less social distancing at the following wave.

We show that SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterised by extensive within-host diversity, which is frequently shared among infected individuals with patterns consistent with geographical structure. Rapid sequencing and publication of consensus genomes have enabled phylogenetic analysis of the virus, demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 evolves relatively slowly1, but with multiple sites in the genome that appear inconsistent with the overall consensus phylogeny2. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 diversity is transmissible, and propose that geographic patterns are generated by co- circulation of distinct viral populations.

Lower accuracy and lower confidence in one's own assessment of the displayed emotions indicate that emotional reading was strongly irritated by the presence of a mask. This means that in natural contexts, the impact of face masks on reading emotions could even be stronger. A drop in performance in reading the emotional states of faces with masks can somehow be expected as being much harder when most visual information of the lower half of the face is blocked out. Face masks may complicate social interaction as they disturb emotion reading from facial expression.

Corticosteroids are the first, and so far only, therapy shown to improve the odds of survival for critically ill patients with Covid-19. The first evidence that common steroids could improve the survival of patients with severe Covid-19 came in June when British researchers conducting a large clinical trial called RECOVERY reported that the use of dexamethasone reduced the death rate by 35% in patients requiring ventilation and by 20% in patients who needed oxygen but were not ventilated. But it cautioned against use of the steroids in patients with non-severe illness, saying that indiscriminate use of any therapy for COVID-19 would potentially rapidly deplete global resources and deprive patients who may benefit from it most as potentially life-saving therapy. advertisement The consistent findings of benefit in these studies provide definitive data that corticosteroids should be first-line treatment for critically ill patients with COVID-19, said Hallie Prescott and Todd Rice, professors of medicine at the University of Michigan and Vanderbilt University, respectively, in an accompanying JAMA editorial.

We describe here potent inhibitory effects on content release and infection by chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) containing the envelope proteins of Zaire ebolavirus (VSV-ZEBOV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (VSV-SARS-CoV-2) elicited by Apilimod and Vacuolin-1, small- molecule inhibitors of the main endosomal phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate/phosphatidylinositol 5-kinase, PIKfyve. We have constructed chimeric forms of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) bearing the fusion proteins of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) or SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and shown that two small-molecule inhibitors of an endosomal lipid kinase (PIKfyve) inhibit viral infection by preventing release of the viral contents from endosomes.

Using the Syrian hamster model of self-limited moderate COVID-19, we defined the specific roles of endothelial and epithelial cells, among other myeloid and non-myeloid lung cell subtypes, for determining the disease course. In depth vascular and pulmonary compartment analyses (i) supported the hypothesis that monocyte-derived macrophages dominate inflammation, (ii) revealed endothelial inflammation status and T-cell attraction, and (iii) showed that CD4+ and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell responses precede viral elimination. Comparison of hamster single-cell sequencing and proteomics with data sets from COVID-19 patients demonstrated inter- species concordance of cellular and molecular host-pathogen interactions. We performed detailed spatiotemporal analyses of cellular and molecular processes in SARS- CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters.

The evolution of flight in bats seem to have selected for a unique set of antiviral immune responses that control virus propagation, while limiting self-damaging inflammatory responses. Bats have evolved novel mechanisms to limit virus-induced pro-inflammatory responses while maintaining type I IFN responses to limit virus propagation (Figure 1). Bats Suppress the Pathological Effects of Excessive Virus-Induced Inflammation While bats are well prepared to control viral infections, they also have mechanisms to avoid over-induction of inflammatory genes. This suggests that many bats have a mechanism to suppress the expression of TNFα, thereby maintaining a balanced response to viral infection.

The use of Povidone Iodine nasal spray and mouthwash during the current COVID-19 pandemic for the reduction of cross infection and protection of healthcare workers. The application of PVP-I mouthwash and nasal spray in this way should reduce the cross-infection risk and therefore help to protect dentists.

Millions of women and girls globally have lost access to contraceptives, abortion services and related care because of the coronavirus pandemic. The World Health Organization this month said two-thirds of 103 countries surveyed between mid-May and early July reported disruptions to family planning and contraception services. Now many women face second-trimester abortions, which are more expensive and complicated, especially because everyone who is involved needs to wear PPE. Abortion access has improved in India, but the pandemic resulted in abortion pill shortages in several states surveyed by Foundation for Reproductive Health Services India.

We propose that therapeutic targeting of PLproCoV2 can suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection and promote anti-viral immunity. Pharmacological inhibition of PLproCoV2 blocks the virus-induced cytopathogenic effect upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, fosters the anti- viral interferon pathway and reduces viral release from infected cells. In human cells, PLproCoV2 cleaves ISG15 from interferon responsive factor 3 (IRF3), blocks its nuclear translocation, and reduces type I interferon responses, whereas PLproSARS preferentially mediates deubiquitination of critical components of the NF-kB pathway.

In addition, neural organoids lack the blood-brain barrier that would normally confer some degree of protection against most viruses, although Iwasaki notes it's possible that SARS-CoV-2 could circumvent this barrier by entering the brain through the olfactory system, something that's been shown in mice infected with common cold-causing coronaviruses. When the tissue was exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus readily infected increasing numbers of cells over the course of four days, suggesting that the coronavirus can use the machinery of neurons to generate more copies of itself.

E. Song et al., Neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 revealed in a human brain organoid model, bioRxiv , doi: 10.1101/2020.06.25.169946, 2020. A BrainSphere organoid infected with SARS-CoV-2, showing the spike protein in green and neuron nuclei in blue Lena Smirnova, Johns Hopkins University If infection of the brain can feasibly occur in some people, it's certainly not common, Nath stresses. In addition, neural organoids lack the blood-brain barrier that would normally confer some degree of protection against most viruses, although Iwasaki notes it's possible that SARS-CoV-2 could circumvent this barrier by entering the brain through the olfactory system, something that's been shown in mice infected with common cold-causing coronaviruses. When the tissue was exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus readily infected increasing numbers of cells over the course of four days, suggesting that the coronavirus can use the machinery of neurons to generate more copies of itself.
Approves Pfizer Coronavirus Vaccine, a First in the West https://nyti.ms/3qj8Mue  For Britain, which has suffered one of Europes highest per capita death tolls from the virus, the decision by its drug regulator was the latest evidence of a vaccination strategy that has been the most aggressive in the West. The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine is delivered as a shot in the arm, like other typical vaccines.

archived recording Researchers in China say a 33-year-old man living in Hong Kong is the first person confirmed to have been reinfected with the coronavirus. I believe this is the first reported case that is confirmed by genome sequencing, said Dr. Kelvin Kai-Wang To, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong. So the case is about a man who gets infected in Hong Kong early in the year, recovers. The reinfection case underscores the need for a vaccine that produces a powerful immune response, scientists said.Credit...Anthony Kwan/Getty Images By Apoorva Mandavilli Aug. 24, 2020  A 33-year-old man was infected a second time with the coronavirus more than four months after his first bout, the first documented case of so-called reinfection, researchers in Hong Kong reported Monday.

The ability to detect neutralizing antibodies can help us gain additional insight into what the existence of antibodies may mean for patients as we continue the fight against COVID-19, said Tim Stenzel, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit, which specifically detects this type of antibody. There are still many unknowns about what the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may tell us about potential immunity, but todays authorization gives us another tool to evaluate those antibodies as we continue to research and study this virus.

The EMAs Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) enabled a rolling review of the investigational single-dose Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate based principally on positive non-clinical data showing that the vaccine candidate elicits a robust immune response, as demonstrated by neutralizing antibodies. 134 Janssen-Cilag International N.V., part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, has initiated a rolling submission with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for its investigational single-dose vaccine candidate for the prevention of COVID-19. JANSSENS INVESTIGATIONAL COVID-19 VACCINE CANDIDATE The investigational Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate leverages the Companys AdVac® vaccine platform, which was also used to develop and manufacture Janssens European Commission-approved Ebola vaccine regimen and construct its Zika, RSV, and HIV investigational vaccine candidates. In addition to the EMA, Janssen is in discussions with other regulatory authorities worldwide, as it prepares to initiate regulatory review processes for use of its investigational single-dose COVID-19 vaccine candidate during the pandemic response period.

The mutation had the effect of markedly increasing the number of functional spikes on the viral surface, she adds. Our data are very clear, the virus becomes much more stable with the mutation, Choe says. A new mutation has appeared in the viral variant most common in New York and Italy that makes this spike both more stable and better able to infect cells.

Working from home may lead to increased screen time, including time spent in front of the computer or television screen late at night, which can impact sleep quality. Interestingly, those who reported smart working  using technology to work from home showed a greater loss in sleep quality than those who did not. The researchers address how stress related to the pandemic likely affected participants sleep, creating a destructive cycle. When it came to specific aspects of sleep, participants showed increased sleep disturbance and daytime dysfunction, less efficient sleep, and an increase in the time it took them to fall asleep.

At a virus density comparable to that observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection, an UV-C dose of just 3.7 mJ/cm2 was sufficient to achieve a 3-log inactivation, and complete inhibition of all viral concentrations was observed with 16.9 mJ/cm2.

Instead, the majority of introductions of the virus seem to have come from Europe and from elsewhere in the United States. The majority is clearly European, said Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who co-wrote a study awaiting peer review. Officially, the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in New York City on February 29, but a new report based on genomic analysis suggests the disease was introduced as early as January, and that most cases were linked to Europe, rather than Asia. Of the remaining isolates, the vast majority (87%) clustered with clade A2a, and the majority of isolates in that clade (72%) are cases of patients with COVID-19 in Europe, suggesting that Europe was the major origin of COVID-19 cases in New York in march, the authors write.

Repair and production of AREG by damaged respiratory epithelial cell cultures in vitro was increased by progesterone. Administration of exogenous progesterone (at concentrations that mimic the luteal phase) to progesterone-depleted adult female mice conferred protection from both lethal and sublethal influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Progesterone treatment promoted faster recovery by increasing TGF-β, IL-6, IL-22, numbers of regulatory Th17 cells expressing CD39, and cellular proliferation, reducing protein leakage into the airway, improving pulmonary function, and upregulating the epidermal growth factor amphiregulin (AREG) in the lungs. Administration of rAREG to progesterone- depleted females promoted pulmonary repair and improved the outcome of IAV infection.

Trump said the halt on travel from Europe would not include the United Kingdom, and that there would be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings. In his speech he said all travel from Europe would be suspended, but a presidential proclamation later said it would only apply to anyone who had been in the EU's Schengen border-free area in the 14 days before their arrival in the US.

Using a Bayesian inference framework on eleven daily data streams and flexible daily population contact parameters, we show that population-average mixing rates dropped by >50% during the lockdown period in March/April, and that the correlation between overall population mobility and transmission-capable mobility was broken in May as these states partially re-opened. Infection fatality rates (IFR) estimates are higher in our analysis (>2%) than previously reported values, likely resulting from the epidemics in these three states affecting the most vulnerable sub-populations, especially the most vulnerable of the 80 age group. A second key question to follow during this time was whether clinical characteristics of the epidemic would improve after the initial surge of cases.

This preprint study reports that immune cells (monocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This was observed by in vitro infection of immune cells and by ex vivo detection of SARS-CoV-2 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with severe COVID-19.

So from a pure anonymization perspective it's good work, de Montjoye told TechCrunch, discussing the technical side of Google's release of location data. Google says it's using aggregated, anonymized data to chart movement trends over time by geography, across different high-level categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. Perhaps a bigger question related to Google's location data dump is around the issue of legal consent to be tracking people in the first place. Similar to the way Google Maps displays whether certain businesses or public places are busy at certain times of day, the resource aggregates anonymized location tracking data from mobile devices to identify large-scale behavior trends.

While the epidemic continued to rapidly grow during the first half of the study period, with a national R over 1, results from the most recent swabs suggest that there was a drop in infections followed by an uptick. We've shown that the prevalence of infection has remained high, reinforcing the need for people to act to help bring infections down and control the virus. But in the latest results these trends are reduced, suggesting that the epidemic has progressed from clustering in certain at-risk groups to generalised spread in the community.

Here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of COVID-19 in US cities from March 14th through March 19th to reveal a power-law scaling relationship to city population size. This means that COVID-19 is spreading faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to become infected in more populous urban areas. We discuss the implications of these observations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also preserving socioeconomic activity.

Measures of inflammation in the kidneys and pancreas, and ectopic fat in the pancreas and liver, were also higher in hospitalised individuals (P<0.05). Multi-organ impairment in low-risk individuals with long COVID. There was evidence of mild organ impairment in the heart (32% of patients), lungs (33%), kidneys (12%), liver (10%), pancreas (17%), and spleen (6%). The BMJ Young, low risk patients with ongoing symptoms of covid-19 had signs of damage to multiple organs four months after initially being infected, a preprint study has suggested.1 Initial data from 201 patients suggest that almost 70% had impairments in one or more organs four months after their initial symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Taken together, these findings suggest that the induction of trained immunity by BCG vaccination results in significant protection against multiple viral infections. Looking at absenteeism has the advantage that any beneficial effects of the BCG vaccine on influenza and other infections may be captured as well, he says. Apparently, a vaccination with BCG also activates the immune system against a viral infection. BCG vaccination protects against experimental viral infection in humans through the induction of cytokines associated with trained immunity.

The aerosolization effect that can occur in toilets, leading to microdroplets that can be inhaled or persist on surface areas, raises some real concerns regarding epidemiologic spread. However, I want to talk about one other potential means of its spread: the toilet. But what do we do to address concerns that the toilet microbiome may put us at risk for COVID-19? That is quite concerning when you consider that flushing a toilet can create an aerosolized plume of these viral particles, which can then spread elsewhere within proximity.

Here's all you need to know about the approach DUHS Vice Chancellor Muhammad Saeed Quraishy called it an important breakthrough in the war against Covid-19, according to a press release issued by the university. Creative commons A team of scientists from the Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) on Monday claimed to have made a significant breakthrough in the treatment against Covid-19 after it prepared intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with plasma obtained from recovered coronavirus patients. The university displayed confidence in the efficacy of its treatment by arguing that the Covid-19 strain currently infecting Pakistanis only has a few mutations and therefore local IVIG from infected patients holds the potential to provide an extremely potent form of immunisation against Covid-19 for Pakistanis.

We deem it both reasonable and plausible that high PM2.5 concentrationsfavored by air temperature inversions or Saharan dust intrusionsare not only modulating but even more so boosting severe outbreaks of COVID-19. Based on these lines of evidence and select examples presented in the following, we hypothesize that COVID-19 prevalence and virulence is linked closely to PM2.5 peaks forming predominantly during (1) the occurrence of air temperature inversions, characterized by rather cool and moist conditions, or (2) desert dust advection conditions characterized by dry and warm air masses.

The designed proteins act as decoys that block cellular entry and aim to be resilient to viral mutational escape. Future refinements to our strategy can enable the rapid development of other therapeutic de novo protein decoys, not limited to neutralizing viruses, but to combat any agent that explicitly interacts with cell surface proteins to cause disease.

Further research into the viability and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces is required. Patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed after two sequential positive respiratory tract sample results. Our data suggest the possibility of extended duration of viral shedding in faeces, for nearly 5 weeks after the patients' respiratory samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Here, we observed that for over half of patients, their faecal samples remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA for a mean of 11·2 days after respiratory tract samples became negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, implying that the virus is actively replicating in the patient's gastrointestinal tract and that faecaloral transmission could occur after viral clearance in the respiratory tract.

Patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed after two sequential positive respiratory tract sample results. Our data suggest the possibility of extended duration of viral shedding in faeces, for nearly 5 weeks after the patients' respiratory samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

Importantly, frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin substantially impedes SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, thereby providing the proof of principle of targeting 1 PRF as an effective antiviral strategy for SARS-CoV-2. Through an unbiased, reporter-based high-throughput compound screen, we identified merafloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibacterial, as a 1 PRF inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. Frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin is robust to mutations within the pseudoknot region and is similarly effective on 1 PRF of other beta coronaviruses.
To our knowledge, our study is the first in the world to show robust cellular immunity remains at six months after infection in individuals who experienced either mild/moderate or asymptomatic COVID-19. Interestingly, we found that cellular immunity is stronger at this time point in those people who had symptomatic infection compared with asymptomatic cases.

We observed that the testes was one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression in 3 independent RNA expression databases (Human Protein Atlas, FAMTOM5 and GETx). High expression of ACE2 in testes raises the possibility that testicular viral reservoirs may play a role in viral persistence in males and should be further investigated. ACE2 was also determined to be highly expressed in testicular cells at the protein levels.

Vaccine peptides were selected based on their frequency as HLA class I and class II personal epitopes (PEPIs) restricted to multiple autologous HLA alleles of individuals in an in silico cohort of 433 subjects of different ethnicities. In addition, PolyPEPI-SCoV-2-specific, polyfunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were detected ex vivo in each of the 17 asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 convalescents blood investigated, 15 months after symptom onset. PolyPEPI- SCoV-2 vaccine administered with Montanide ISA 51VG adjuvant generated robust, Th1-biased CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against all four structural proteins of the virus, as well as binding antibodies upon subcutaneous injection into BALB/c and CD34+ transgenic mice.

Executive Chair Professor Fiona Watt commented: It is truly remarkable how fast this vaccine has progressed, with our support, through early clinical trials, and it is very encouraging that it shows no safety concerns and evokes strong immune responses. However, it seems that both antibody and T cell immunity are important, and this vaccine triggers both responses. A phase I/II trial of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 being developed by the University of Oxford has found that the vaccine is safe, causes few side effects, and induces strong immune responses.

Coronavirus patients tend to be most contagious just before they develop symptoms and during the first week of illness. If you look at the numbers (and not at the viral exponential charts that have been spreading as fast as the panic they cause), you'll find out that you 've been exposing yourself and the others to higher risk before this whole Coronavirus thing even started.

SARS-CoV-2 and its Spike protein directly bind platelet ACE2 and enhance platelet activation in vitro. SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binds to ACE2 and phosphorylates ACE2, leading to MAPK signaling activation (phosphorylation of Erk, p-38, and JNK) and subsequent platelet activation, coagulation factors release, and inflammatory cytokines secretion. Collectively, these data suggest that SARS- CoV-2-activated platelets may result in the pro-thrombotic state described in COVID-19 patients.

They're going to be developing a vaccine that works in a normal, healthy population, and they're going to miss the elderly. So, a vaccine that is effective in healthy adults may not work well at either the beginning or end of life. Time will tell if any of them will work well on older people, says Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a private-public partnership that provides vaccines for nearly half of the world's children. But Ofer Levy, a physician-scientist at Boston Children's Hospital, worries that vaccines being designed today are not going to be effective enough for the people who need them most: older adults.

It could be the portion of their population not protected by Vitamin K status are allowing a more limited pandemic outcome there. Conclusions: Vitamin K status was reduced in patients with COVID-19 and related to poor prognosis. Also, low vitamin K status seems to be associated with accelerated elastin degradation. An intervention trial is now needed to assess whether vitamin K administration improves outcome in patients with COVID-19. We hypothesized that vitamin K status is reduced in patients with severe COVID-19.

An intervention trial is now needed to assess whether vitamin K administration improves outcome in patients with COVID-19. We hypothesized that vitamin K status is reduced in patients with severe COVID-19.

The BNT162b2 vaccine candidate fully protected the lungs of immunised rhesus macaques from infectious SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Prime-boost vaccination of rhesus macaques elicited authentic SARS- CoV-2 neutralising geometric mean titers 10.2 to 18.0 times that of a SARS- CoV-2 convalescent human serum panel. In this study, we report the design, preclinical development, immunogenicity and anti-viral protective effect in rhesus macaques of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate.

In our study, we demonstrate that although SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the epithelium for efficient replication, the neighboring endothelial cells are affected, e.g., by the epithelial cytokine release, which results in the damage of the alveolar barrier function and viral dissemination. With prolonged infection, both cell types are damaged, and the barrier function is deteriorated, allowing the viral particles to overbear.

Ecuador's coronavirus nightmare in pictures They said authorities had been unable to keep up with the huge rise in deaths, leaving corpses wrapped in sheets in family homes and even in the streets. Ecuador as a whole has had 8,225 confirmed cases of coronavirus to date, according to Johns Hopkins University, though a lack of widespread testing means this is likely a significant undercount.

Conclusions and relevance: In this preliminary study of adult outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19, patients treated with fluvoxamine, compared with placebo, had a lower likelihood of clinical deterioration over 15 days. The use of fluvoxamine for the treatment of COVID-19 is considered investigational, which means the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved it for this use. Ivermectin to prevent hospitalizations in patients with COVID-19 (IVERCOR-COVID19): a structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. Clinical deterioration occurred in 0 of 80 patients in the fluvoxamine group and in 6 of 72 patients in the placebo group (absolute difference, 8.7% [95% CI, 1.8%-16.4%] from survival analysis; log-rank P = .009).

Now, researchers at Duke University have identified a number of silent mutations in the roughly 30,000 letters of the virus's genetic code that helped it thrive once it made the leap -- and possibly helped set the stage for the global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, appears to have evolved silent changes to its RNA code that gave it a biological edge over previous strains. The researchers report that so-called silent mutations in two other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, dubbed Nsp4 and Nsp16, appear to have given the virus a biological edge over previous strains without altering the proteins they encode.

This randomized trial did not demonstrate a significant benefit of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for COVID-19, the authors of the study, a team of US and Canadian researchers, wrote in the paper. Analysis of the two treatment groups showed that the difference in the incidence of new illness compatible with COVID-19 was not statistically significant11.8% of those receiving hydroxychloroquine (49 of 414) got sick, compared with 14.3% of those receiving placebo (58 of 407). In the current trial, the long delay between perceived exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the initiation of hydroxychloroquine ( 3 days in most participants) suggests what was being assessed was prevention of symptoms or progression of COVID-19, rather than prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, Myron Cohen, MD, of the Institute for Global and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, wrote.

Here, we combine empirical observations of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 transmission and extreme value statistics to show that the distribution of secondary cases is consistent with being fat-tailed, implying that large superspreading events are extremal, yet probable, occurrences. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 SSEs correspond to fat tails.

The results reveal that public disclosure can help people target their social distancing and this proves especially helpful for vulnerable populations who can more easily avoid areas with a higher rate of infection. According to the authors, this publicly available data spurred signicant changes in the commuting patterns of people: individuals were more likely to commute to the districts with less conrmed cases, and less likely to commute to the districts with more cases.

We examined the functional and structural consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a reconstituted human bronchial epithelium model. SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics reveals a variable infection gradient in the respiratory tract. This study identifies cilia damage as a pathogenic mechanism that could facilitate SARS- CoV-2 spread to the deeper lung parenchyma. Rather, SARS-CoV-2 replication led to a rapid loss of the ciliary layer, characterized at the ultrastructural level by axoneme loss and misorientation of remaining basal bodies.

Having frequent sauna baths has been found to be associated with reduced risk of acute and chronic disease conditions. Frequent sauna baths may be associated with a reduced risk of acute and chronic respiratory conditions in a middle-aged male Caucasian population. Conclusions: Frequent sauna baths is associated with reduced pneumonia risk in a middle-aged male Caucasian population. Still, its possible that regular sauna bathing helps reduce blood pressure, inflammation, oxidative stress, circulation of bad cholesterol and stiffness in the arteries, the authors note.

CORRECTION (April 13, 2020, 1:47 p.m.): In describing what it would take for the new coronavirus to begin to die out, a previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the R value falling below zero, which is not possible. Given that includes people who probably do have the coronavirus (since asymptomatic cases are fairly common), we can assume the rate of false positives is even lower -- for the purpose of the scenarios, we'll guess that it's 0.2 percent.

View this table: View inline View popup Table 1 Associations between COVID-19 mortality by country, latitude and % of population 65 years The proportion of older people in each country impacts greatly on COVID-19 mortality, but after adjustment for this, a strong association remains across the Northern hemisphere between latitude and higher COVID-19 mortality. This analysis supports the link between latitude and COVID-19 mortality reported within the USA by Dr Kohlmeier.1 Evidence linking vitamin D deficiency with COVID-19 severity is circumstantial but growing. There are exceptions, but COVID-19 mortality correlates with reported vitamin D levels across Europe,7 and in sunnier Brazil, where mortality is rising, 28% prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is reported.8 An association between vitamin D insufficiency and COVID-19 severity is supported by substantial evidence of its impact on cytokine response to pathogens.7 A direct effect of ultraviolet light on the environmental survival of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is also possible but would not explain the association between mortality and ethnicity,9 whereas people with dark skin need more ultraviolet exposure for equivalent vitamin D synthesis.

He said it's unlikely that the outbreak will end this summer, and it's very likely that a second wave will take place after the fall. I said repeatedly two weeks ago that it's unlikely the pandemic will be over by the summer, that it will largely last till the next year. There is a high probability of a second international outbreak.

This may be because vitamin D is important in regulation and suppression of the inflammatory cytokine response, which causes the severe consequences of COVID-19 and 'acute respiratory distress syndrome' associated with ventilation and death. The authors propose that, whereas optimising vitamin D levels will certainly benefit bone and muscle health, the data suggests that it is also likely to reduce serious COVID-19 complications.

Conclusions: the suitability of SARS-CoV-2-S-IgG commercial immunoassays for inferring neutralizing activity of sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients varies widely across tests and is influenced by the time of sera collection after the onset of symptoms. Overall, the degree correlation between antibody titers resulting in 50% virus neutralization (NtAb50) in the pseudotyped virus assay and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels was strong for the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Rho=0.73) and moderate for the remaining assays (Rho=0.48 to 0.59). Patients and Methods: Ninety sera from 51 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were assayed by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, the MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assays.

It supports an earlier study published in April that evaluated MK-7 in 123 patients with COVID-19 and 184 controls, revealing a link between vitamin K2 deficiency and disease severity. The researchers write: Therefore, MK-7 deficiency can be a risk factor for increasing the severity of the COVID-19 disease and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with comorbid conditions tend to develop acute manifestations. This paper strengthens the concept that vitamin K2 as MK-7 is a nutrient with substantial ability to protect pulmonary function during an active virus. According to the authors, a profound increase in inactive matrix Gla protein (MGP) levels were observed in COVID-19 patients, indicating a poor K2 status and associated increased risk of mortality from comorbidities (such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases). This is the second study that associates K2 status with outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

For instance, troponin, the marker used in adults to diagnose heart attacks, was 50 times its normal level in children with MIS-C. Evidence suggests that children with MIS-C have immense inflammation and potential tissue injury to the heart, and we will need to follow these children closely to understand what implications they may have in the long term, Dr. Moreira said. Source: University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), believed to be linked to COVID-19, damages the heart to such an extent that some children will need lifelong monitoring and interventions, said the senior author of a medical literature review published Sept. 4 in EClinicalMedicine.

According to the authors, this finding suggests that children can carry a high viral load, meaning they are more contagious, regardless of their susceptibility to developing COVID-19 infection. The researchers note that although children with COVID-19 are not as likely to become as seriously ill as adults, as asymptomatic carriers or carriers with few symptoms attending school, they can spread infection and bring the virus into their homes.

We propose that the daily evolution of Covid-19 can be modelled by the following discrete-time equations: (1) (2) (3) (4) where t means the day, T means the duration of asymptomatic (incubation time) and symptomatic infected phases, both herein assumed to be 14 days. We hope the present model can contribute to global efforts made to understand and control the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, as current (in case of Covid-19) and future, yet unknown, infectious diseases will continue to impact us, the development of simple but efficient models to track pandemics evolution based on daily updated data may be valuable not only for Covid-19 but also for potential future outbreaks to come.

A study awaiting peer review from scientists at Princeton University, the University of California-Los Angeles and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) posted online Wednesday indicated that the COVID-19 virus could remain viable in the air up to 3 hours post aerosolization, while remaining alive on plastic and other surfaces for up to three days. ADVERTISEMENT The test results suggest that humans could be infected by the disease simply carried through the air or on a solid surface, even if direct contact with an infected person does not occur. Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 is plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days, reads the study's abstract.

Several studies have revealed that the hyper-inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. Importantly, when adjusting for disease severity score, common laboratory inflammation markers, hypoxia and other vitals, demographics, and a range of comorbidities, IL-6 and TNF-α serum levels remained independent and significant predictors of disease severity and death.

Pooling strategies for testing potentially infected persons are a practically free way of multiplying the efficiency of the tests while the level of infection of the population is still low. If the infection level of the population is low, this can lead to considerable increases in testing efficiency.

The caves, located in China's southern Yunnan Province, are thought to hold the key to understanding how the novel coronavirus evolved in bats. The caves in Yunnan Province, south China, are where scientists hope to find evidence of how the coronavirus evolved in bats. China is guarding ancient caves where bats infected with coronavirus variants once lived in an attempt to control research into the outbreak, The Associated Press reported. Advertisement But China is taking steps to safeguard the site and control who gets access, The AP said, adding that a team of its journalists were tailed by security services and refused entry into one of the caves.

We now know that we are in the current phase of the pandemic where we have to practically cut off all social contacts if we want to have any chance of keeping the number of infected people as low as possible, Patrick Larscheid, a public health officer in Berlin, told DW. The German Cultural Council said the culture and media sector has already been severely affected by trade fair and event cancellations.

In contrast, our analysis detects significant positive episodic diversifying selection acting on the bat virus lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged from, accompanied by an adaptive depletion in CpG composition presumed to be linked to the action of antiviral mechanisms in ancestral hosts. The closest bat virus to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 (sharing an ancestor 1976), is a recombinant with a structure that includes differential CpG content in Spike; clear evidence of coinfection and evolution in bats without involvement of other species. Collectively our results demonstrate the progenitor of SARS- CoV-2 was capable of near immediate human-human transmission as a consequence of its adaptive evolutionary history in bats, not humans.

What you should do if you or a loved one tests positive for Covid-19 Viewers who trusted CNN for their news on Covid-19 engaged in an average of 3.85 preventative behaviors during the study period, while people who trusted Fox News took an average of 3.41 safety precautions. In addition, the study found Fox News enthusiasts consistently practiced fewer preventative measures -- such as wearing a mask, sanitizing hands, avoiding restaurants and canceling social plans -- than CNN fans. Devotees of Fox News consistently practiced more risky behaviors -- such as going out to a bar or club, attending gatherings of more than 10 people or visiting others in their homes -- than CNN viewers, the study found. Overall, Fox viewers engaged in an average of 1.25 risky behaviors during the study period, while CNN viewers participated in 0.94 of such risky behaviors such as going to other people's homes and attending larger gatherings.

Several months after vaccination, animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 resulting in rapid recall of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein T and B cell responses. Vaccination with INO-4800 induced T cell responses and neutralizing antibody responses against both the D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Here, we assess immunogenicity and anamnestic protective efficacy in rhesus macaques of the intradermal (ID)-delivered SARS-CoV-2 spike DNA vaccine, INO-4800. These studies support the immune impact of INO-4800 for inducing both humoral and cellular arms of the adaptive immune system which are likely important for providing durable protection against COVID-19 disease.

It reported that stillbirths increased from 14 per 1,000 births before the country went into lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus in late March, to 21 per 1,000 births by the end of May  a rise of 50%. The study, led by Ashish K.C., a perinatal epidemiologist at Uppsala University, Sweden, and his colleagues, found that although the rate of stillbirths jumped, the overall number was unchanged during the pandemic. Scotland  one of a few countries that collates data on stillbirths and infant deaths monthly  has also detected an uptick in the rate of stillbirths in the months of the pandemic.

This means the vaccine resembles the coronavirus and the immune system can learn how to attack it. Scientists did this by transferring the genetic instructions for the coronavirus's spike protein \- the crucial tool it uses to invade our cells - to the vaccine they were developing. They are injecting coronavirus RNA (its genetic code), which then starts making viral proteins in order to trigger an immune response.

Median T-cell responses were 50% higher in donors who had experienced an initial symptomatic infection indicating that the severity of primary infection establishes a setpoint for cellular immunity that lasts for at least 6 months. In conclusion, our data are reassuring that functional SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses are retained at six months following infection although the magnitude of this response is related to the clinical features of primary infection.

A single dose of BCG:CoVac was sufficient to induce high-titre SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that were detectable as early as 2 weeks post-vaccination; NAb levels were greater than that seen in the sera of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. This study describes a unique COVID-19 vaccine candidate, termed BCG:CoVac, that when delivered as a single dose induces potent SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity in mice, particularly through generation of high-titre, anti-viral neutralising antibodies.

Combined with the follow-up virologic, radiological and pathological findings, the monkeys with re- exposure showed no recurrence of COVID-19, similarly to the infected monkey without rechallenge. Notably, neither viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs along timeline nor viral replication in all primary tissue compartments at 5 days post- reinfection (dpr) was found in re-exposed monkeys.

However, whether the increasing prevalence of the S-614G variant represents a fitness advantage that improves replication and/or transmission in humans or is merely due to founder effects remains elusive. Here, we generated isogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants and demonstrate that the S-614G variant has (i) enhanced binding to human ACE2, (ii) increased replication in primary human bronchial and nasal airway epithelial cultures as well as in a novel human ACE2 knock-in mouse model, and (iii) markedly increased replication and transmissibility in hamster and ferret models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our data show that while the S-614G substitution results in subtle increases in binding and replication in vitro , it provides a real competitive advantage in vivo , particularly during the transmission bottle neck, providing an explanation for the global predominance of S-614G variant among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently circulating.

Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) acquire special attention due to its specificity and environment friendly approach with a wide application in industry and medicine due to its antibacterial, antifungal, larvicidal and anti-parasitic characters. As an antiviral agent, Ag NPs can interfere with viral replication by two separate mechanisms of adhesion to the surface of the viral envelope. The antiviral activity test was designed to determine the inactivation of viral particles upon short exposure to the products, which in this case were the Ag-based treated polycotton samples incubated in liquid media.

Yes, influenza is a serious disease, but the evidence shows quite strongly at this point that COVID-19 is far more of an issue. Right off the bat it seems like COVID-19 is worse than the flu  0.1% compared to 0.6% makes it about 6x as deadly. When we take the most appropriate figures on both diseases, COVID-19 comes out as deadlier in every aspect. COVID-19 is FAR deadlier than influenza. Sadly, the evidence shows that COVID-19 is far deadlier than influenza, and just overall a very nasty disease.

Our results indicate that Alpha-coronavirus is more conducive to escape host immune recognition, and also provide novel ideas for the development of vaccines targeting S protein. Coronavirus spike (S) protein is considered as a major target for vaccine development. Then, structural and immunological analyses were used to explore differences in the immune response with RBDs among these coronaviruses.

In this scenario, as susceptibility declines, the climate plays a more substantial role in determining pandemic peak size (Fig. Furthermore, the relative importance of climate drivers when compared with high population susceptibility during the pandemic stage of an emerging infection such as SARS-CoV-2 has not been fully characterized. In terms of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, our results imply that both tropical and temperate locations should prepare for severe outbreaks of the disease and that summertime temperatures will not effectively limit the spread of the infection. A preliminary analysis of nonpharmaceutical control measures indicates that they may moderate the pandemic-climate interaction through susceptible depletion.

Ontarios new long-term care guidelines have broadened the virus testing criteria, by allowing individuals with uncharacteristic symptoms related to COVID-19 to be tested. The province is also helping to significantly expand the capacity of public health units to conduct contact tracing and case management, both of which are critical to stopping the spread of the virus, by enabling the use of volunteers, including retired nurses and medical students. By implementing this strategy, Ontario expects to double the number of tests processed each day to 8,000 by April 15, 2020 and 14,000 by April 29, 2020, at which point overall lab capacity will have been further expanded.

This point has to do with the evolution of the virus in the human host. Later on, the spread of the infection reduces the pool of susceptible hosts and may reverse the selection on virulence. Infectious sources are susceptible to evolution, and selective pressure by host characteristics and measure to control the pandemic may lead to emergence of more aggressive or indolent strains. More specifically, we expect drastic changes of virulence between early and later stages of global pandemics, but also between different stages of the pathogen life cycle.

One of the first proteins produced during viral infection, NSP1, binds to the host ribosome and blocks the mRNA entry channel. In spite of the presence of NSP1 on the ribosome, viral translation proceeds however. Thus, NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper, shutting down host translation or fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation depending on the presence of the SL1 5UTR hairpin. We show that NSP1 remains bound on the ribosome during viral translation.

Considering the presence of Nsp1 in the post- termination 80S ribosomal complex simultaneously with eRF1, we hypothesized that Nsp1 may be involved in translation termination. We show the direct influence of Nsp1 on translation termination. We identify that activity of Nsp1 in translation termination is localized in its N-terminal domain. Nsp1 inhibits host translation initiation by binding to the entry channel of the 40S ribosome subunit.

We further present the impact of several scenarios of patient influx on healthcare system utilization, and provide an R software package for predicting hospital-bed utilization. Interpretation: We developed a model that, given basic easily obtained data as input, accurately predicts total and critical care hospital utilization. The model predicts the patient's entire disease course in terms of clinical states, from which we derive the patient's hospital length-of-stay, length-of-stay in critical state, the risk of in-hospital mortality, and total and critical care hospital-bed utilization. The model enables evaluating the impact of various patient influx scenarios on hospital utilization and planning ahead of hospital resource allocation. There is a need for a model to help planners assess expected COVID-19 hospital resource utilization.

The study, published in the December print issue of the journal Neurobiology of Disease, is the first to show that SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins can cause this barrier to become leaky, potentially disrupting the delicate neural networks within the brain. Our findings support the implication that SARS-CoV-2, or its shed spike proteins circulating in the blood stream, could cause destabilization of the blood-brain barrier in key brain regions, Dr. Ramirez said. Moreover, as Dr. Buzhdygan explained, the brain vasculature is extremely branched, so even a small amount of neuroinflammation can be very damaging. Based on the team's observations of ACE2 expression in the brain, this neurological damage could be extensive in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing health conditions in which the vasculature has already suffered some amount of injury.

The study, published in the December print issue of the journal Neurobiology of Disease, is the first to show that SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins can cause this barrier to become leaky, potentially disrupting the delicate neural networks within the brain. Our findings support the implication that SARS-CoV-2, or its shed spike proteins circulating in the blood stream, could cause destabilization of the blood-brain barrier in key brain regions, Dr. Ramirez said.

Speaking at the press conference after the meeting, Wilmes announced the lockdown is set to start on Wednesday (17 March) and run until 5 April. Belgium's health minister Maggie De Block (Open VLD) told local media after the meeting that tightening measures come at a crucial moment and are necessary to flatten the curve so that the number of patients does not rise too strongly and overburdens the healthcare system.

Shark Allies, a nonprofit that advocates for the protection of sharks, projects that some 500,000 sharks could be killed if a coronavirus vaccine with shark squalene proves to be effective. Brendl says many pharmaceutical companies are using shark squalene to produce a coronavirus vaccine and that if everyone in the world received two doses, 500,000 sharks would have to be slaughtered to meet the demand. However some scientists believe two doses may be needed to immunise the population, meaning around 500,000 sharks would need to be slaughtered, according to the California-based group's calculations.

But the mutation appears to have made the pandemic spread further and faster than it would have without it. Patients with that strain of coronavirus carried more virus particles than other people, meaning they were probably more infectious, the study found. But one mutation near the beginning of the pandemic did make a difference, multiple new findings suggest, helping the virus spread more easily from person to person and making the pandemic harder to stop.

Conclusion Associations between gut microbiota composition, levels of cytokines and inflammatory markers in patients with COVID-19 suggest that the gut microbiome is involved in the magnitude of COVID-19 severity possibly via modulating host immune responses. Nevertheless, this survey of gut microbiota alterations in association with immune dysregulation revealed that gut microorganisms are likely involved in the modulation of host inflammatory responses in COVID-19. Conclusion: Associations between gut microbiota composition, levels of cytokines and inflammatory markers in patients with COVID-19 suggest that the gut microbiome is involved in the magnitude of COVID-19 severity possibly via modulating host immune responses. They hypothesized gut microbiota would be associated with host inflammatory immune responses in COVID-19. Composition of the gut microbiota in patients with COVID-19 is concordant with disease severity and magnitude of plasma concentrations of several inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and blood markers of tissue damage.

Conclusions To the best of our knowledge this is the first study evaluating disease outcomes in a large set of laboratory-positive cases of symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection and factors associated with illness severity was characterized. Our results may contribute to the current knowledge of SARS-COV-2 pathogenicity and to identify populations at increased risk of a poorer outcome after reinfection. We used risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate predictors of severe (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) secondary SARS-COV-2 infection. In multiple analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of severe symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection were increasing age (RR per year = 1.007, 95% CI 1.003-1.010), comorbidities (namely obesity [RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.24], asthma [RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.50], type 2 diabetes mellitus [RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.38] and previous severe laboratory- confirmed COVID-19 (RR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.39).

Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively inactivated by Holder pasteurisation, and confirm that existing milk bank processes will effectively mitigate the risk of transmission of SARS-COV-2 to vulnerable infants through pasteurised donor human milk. Cold storage of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk (either at 4°C or - 30°C) did not significantly impact infectious viral load over a 48 hour period.

It seems misleading to draw direct comparisons between Sweden and the UK. But the paper argues, firstly, that it is a misconception that Sweden has no restrictions or lockdown and, secondly, that assertions that the countrys strategy is successful are far from clear. The report noted the differing social conditions between the UK and Nordic countries, which have a high standard of living, less labour market insecurity, and higher levels of trust. Nor is it justifiable to imagine that policies adopted there can be applied seamlessly in the UK. In a media briefing on 25 September, Gabriel Scally, visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a member of Independent SAGE, said Swedens model was being praised too readily in some sections of the UK media.

We have provided evidence that chloroquine is effective in preventing SARS-CoV infection in cell culture if the drug is added to the cells 24 h prior to infection. In vitro inhibition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus by chloroquine. These data clearly show that addition of chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV if the drug is added immediately following virus adsorption. Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection.

Here, in 10 terminally-ill, critical COVID-19 patients we report profound elevation of plasma IL-6 and CCL5 (RANTES), decreased CD8+ T cell levels, and SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia. Following compassionate care treatment with the CCR5 blocking antibody leronlimab, we observed complete CCR5 receptor occupancy on macrophage and T cells, rapid reduction of plasma IL-6, restoration of the CD4/CD8 ratio, and a significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia. These results demonstrate a novel approach to resolving unchecked inflammation, restoring immunologic deficiencies, and reducing SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load via disruption of the CCL5-CCR5 axis, and support randomized clinical trials to assess clinical efficacy of leronlimab-mediated inhibition of CCR5 for COVID-19.

2: SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with markers of inflammation and disease severity. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially in the plasma, are predictive of mortality. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially within plasma, are associated with systemic inflammation, disease progression, and increased risk of death.

The iminosugar Miglustat is a well-characterized drug for the treatment of rare genetic lysosome storage diseases such as Gaucher and Niemann-Pick type C, and has also been described to be active against a variety of enveloped viruses. The wealth of available data on the clinical use of Miglustat for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders and the antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 make it an ideal candidate for drug repurposing.

( a ) Illustration of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, with receptor binding domain in contact with the human ACE2 receptor on the surface of a lung epithelial cell. The SARS-CoV-2 virus gains entry to human cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor by the interaction of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein on the viral surface4,5,6,7,8. We have isolated nanobodies that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain and block spike protein interaction with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with 15 nM affinity. We have isolated nanobodies that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain and block spike protein interaction with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with 1-5 nM affinity.

We report here the safety of a single subcutaneous injection of Peg-IFN-α2a in two patients with IEIs affecting the production of type I IFNs associated with a predisposition to severe COVID-19. The rationale for proposing IFN-α2a treatment to these two patients was based on (i) the impairment of type I IFN production by both AD TLR3 and IRF3 deficiencies [2,3,4,5]; (ii) the development of severe COVID-19, sometimes with a fatal outcome, in some patients with IEIs affecting type I IFN production; (iii) the anosmia/ageusia in both patients, whose IEI predispose to HSE, and the tropism of SARS-Cov2 for the central nervous system, which together stressed a risk of neurological manifestations of COVID-19; (iv) the high susceptibility of TLR3-deficient fibroblasts to SARS-Cov2 in vitro, a phenotype rescued by exogenous type I IFN; (v) the diagnosis of these two patients with COVID-19 at a very early stage of clinical manifestations, placing both patients in the so-called first phase of COVID-19; and (vi) the known safety profile of a single dose of Peg-IFN-α2a.

Methods We establish a vascularised lung-on-chip infection model consisting of a co-culture of primary human alveolar epithelial cells (epithelial) and human lung microvascular endothelial cells (endothelial), with the optional addition of CD14+ macrophages to the epithelial side. A combination of qRT-PCR, RNAscope, immunofluorescence, and ELISA measurements are used to study the dynamics of viral replication and host responses to a low dose infection of SARS-CoV-2 delivered to the apical surface of the epithelial face maintained at an air-liquid interface.

The prospective goal of generating this very large collection was to select pairs of highly potent individual antibodies that could simultaneously bind the RBD spike, and thus might be ideal partners for a therapeutic antibody cocktail that not only could be an effective treatment, but might also protect against antibody resistance resulting from virus escape mutants that could arise in response to selective pressure from single-antibody treatments. Our data strongly support the notion that cocktail therapy may provide a powerful way to minimize mutational escape by SARS-CoV-2; in particular, our studies point to the potential value of antibody cocktails in which two antibodies were chosen so as to bind to distinct and non-overlapping regions of the viral target (in this case, the RBD of the spike protein), and thus require the unlikely occurrence of simultaneous mutations at two distinct genetic sites for viral escape. To functionally confirm that the spike protein mutations detected by sequencing are responsible for the loss of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by the antibodies, we generated VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoparticles expressing the individual identified spike mutations. For an antibody cocktail in which the components demonstrate complete competition (REGN10989+REGN10934), a single amino acid substitution was sufficient to ablate neutralization of the cocktail; hence, both of these antibodies require binding to the Glu484 residue in order to neutralize SARS-CoV-2.

In agreement with our findings, a recent report shows inactivation of SARS- CoV-2 in N95 respirators after 60 minutes exposure to 70°C dry heat.23 Others have shown that shorter thermal disinfection protocols (15 to 40 min at 75°C to 100°C and 0% to 100% relative humidity) maintain the fit and filtration of N95 respirators after multiple disinfection cycles, but without testing the viricidal effects of those protocols.2629 Beyond thermal disinfection, alternative decontamination procedures have been studied, including ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation (250280 nm), autoclaving or chemical treatments using 70% ethanol or 2% chlorine solutions (some references from nonpeer-reviewed preprint).23,2835 Autoclaving and chemical treatments have been shown to rapidly degrade filtration efficiency of N95 respirators and are therefore ineligible for clinical use.23,28,3436 In contrast, UV light decontamination systems may represent a promising approach as they seem to maintain respirator function and inactivate SARS- CoV-2.23,33 However, the scalability of UV decontamination may be limited, as stacking of the masks and consequent shadowing may further impair the limited penetration depth of UV light in porous N95 filter material.28 In conjunction with alternative reprocessing strategies, thermal disinfection can be used as a rapidly applicable emergency measure to alleviate the present global shortage of N95 respirators. INTERPRETATION: Thermal disinfection successfully decontaminated N95 respirators without impairing structural integrity or function. Results A single heat treatment inactivated both SARS-CoV-2 (undetectable, detection limit: 100 TCID50/ml) and E. coli (0 colonies at 50%RH) in all four respirator models.

Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in children with PIMS-TS. This therefore offers a widening of the value of serology in the identification and understanding of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2. Serological responses were detected against purified near-full-length trimeric SARS-CoV-2 viral spike glycoprotein by ELISA. Below, we present findings demonstrating that children with PIMS-TS, who are PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2, can present with very high levels of IgG antibody to the virus. Tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR gave negative results.

However, it appears to be cleaved by an enzyme (furin) that is abundant in lungs, which suggests the cleavage site is crucial for virus entry into human cells. With this new information, Olvera de la Cruz and Qiao next plan to work with Northwestern chemists and pharmacologists to design a new drug that could bind to the spike protein.

To address this issue, we tested the unconventional approach of skipping the RNA extraction step altogether and directly loading patient swab material into the RT-qPCR mix. We hypothesized that SARS- CoV-2 RNA could be detected from NP samples via a direct RT-qPCR assay that omits the RNA extraction step altogether, and tested this hypothesis on a series of blinded clinical samples.

We also highlight the importance of a fruitful antibody development pipeline to combat the potential escape plans of SARS-CoV-2, including somatic mutations and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). We discuss these neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 and highlight how the robust antibody pipeline can help to combat the escape strategies presented by SARS-CoV-2.
We aimed to test the hypothesis that low vitamin K status is a common characteristic of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to population controls; and that low vitamin K status predicts mortality in COVID-19 patients. Low vitamin K status predicts mortality in a cohort of 138 hospitalized patients with COVI In conclusion, we found that low Vitamin K status predicted mortality in patients with COVID-19 supporting a potential role of Vitamin K in COVID-19.

We emphasize that the classical formula, 1  1/ R 0, remains applicable to describe herd immunity thresholds for random vaccination, but not for immunity induced by infection which is naturally selective. Herd immunity thresholds are then calculated as 1  (1/ R 0)1/(1+ CV 2) or 1  (1/ R 0)1/(1+2 CV 2), depending on whether variation is on susceptibility or exposure. These findings have profound consequences for the governance of the current pandemic given that some populations may be close to achieving herd immunity despite being under more or less strict social distancing measures.

As COVID-19 cases mount in Mexico and the death toll soars  Mexico only trails Brazil and the United States in total pandemic fatalities  López- Gatell and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador have increasingly pinned Mexicos pandemic problems on its poor nutrition habits  soda consumption chief among them. Its a pretext because the fact is that sugary drinks contribute to gaining weight and obesity in Mexico is nothing new. Mexicos beverage industry shot back at López-Gatell, saying Mexicans consume less than 6% of their daily calories from sugary drinks and alleging his comments show the need to find a public enemy to hold responsible for the health crisis the country confronts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health proponents, however, call the castigation of big soda long overdue.

Antibodies have the potential to be an important bridge until the vaccine is available, says Ajay Nirula, a vice president at Eli Lilly, one of several large companies investing in them. While the world is transfixed by the high-stakes race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, an equally crucial competition is heating up to produce targeted antibodies that could provide an instant immunity boost against the virus. Kyratsous says even if monoclonal antibodies dont beat vaccines to the finish line, they still might have a role to play against COVID-19.

Since the novel coronavirus was first discovered in China, it has undergone many mutations but WHO experts say such changes are to be expected and that they have not been so extreme as to make vaccines being developed against it ineffective. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth via CN) (CN)  A potentially dangerous mutation of the novel coronavirus found to be spreading rapidly in the United Kingdom is causing alarm across Europe and prompting countries to close off travel with Britain. Drosten notes that the new mutant also carries a deletion in another viral gene, ORF8, that previous studies suggest might reduce the virus ability to spread. On Saturday, the U.K. imposed strict lockdown measures to stop the spread of a new variant of the virus that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said is much more transmissible, though he said there was no evidence it was more lethal or more resistant to vaccines.
Since the novel coronavirus was first discovered in China, it has undergone many mutations but WHO experts say such changes are to be expected and that they have not been so extreme as to make vaccines being developed against it ineffective. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth via CN) (CN)  A potentially dangerous mutation of the novel coronavirus found to be spreading rapidly in the United Kingdom is causing alarm across Europe and prompting countries to close off travel with Britain. Drosten notes that the new mutant also carries a deletion in another viral gene, ORF8, that previous studies suggest might reduce the virus ability to spread. On Saturday, the U.K. imposed strict lockdown measures to stop the spread of a new variant of the virus that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said is much more transmissible, though he said there was no evidence it was more lethal or more resistant to vaccines.
But China National Biotec Group (CNBG), the Sinopharm unit developing two of the emergency use vaccines, and Sinovac have confirmed that at least tens of thousands of people have been inoculated. In reality, their vaccines had already been deployed months earlier this summer for emergency use and shot into the arms of people that China deems vulnerable to COVID-19, including front-line medical workers and critical service providers in large cities.

Metabolic changes caused by obesity  such as insulin resistance and inflammation  make it difficult for individuals with obesity to fight some infections, a trend that can be seen in other infectious diseases, such as influenza and hepatitis. Obesity already is associated with numerous underlying risk factors for COVID-19, including hypertension, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney and liver disease. Given the significant threat COVID-19 represents to individuals with obesity, healthy food policies can play a supportive  and especially important  role in mitigating COVID-19 mortality and morbidity, he says. The new paper reviews immunological and biomedical data to provide a detailed layout of the mechanisms and pathways that link obesity with increased risk of COVID-19 as well as an increased likelihood of developing more severe complications from the virus.

Among the those with severe disease, the percentage with normal radiographic and CT results was substantially lower at 2.9%. There are going to be people who are young who are going to wind up getting seriously ill. The virus has also disproportionately affected people of color. With testing limited and many cases mild or asymptomatic, experts say many cases go unreported.

These agreements are critical to fulfil the key objective of the ACT- Accelerator: to ensure all countries, regardless of income, have fair access to new tests and tools to fight COVID-19. Both companies' tests are faster and cheaper than laboratory-based tests, enabling countries to increase the pace of testing, tracing and treating people for COVID-19 at the point of care particularly in areas with under-resourced health systems. These two arrangements will make available to LMICs 120 million antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag RDTs) - priced at a maximum of US$5 per unit - over a period of six months.

That means the virus probably does not cause taste loss through direct infection of these cells, the researchers say. Although the mouse version of ACE2 isn't susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, studying where it's expressed in mice could help clarify what happens when people become infected and lose the sense of taste.

Inflammaging has many implications for COVID-19 patients: The accumulation of senescent cells in the respiratory tract of older patients may be involved in the initiation of an inflammatory cascade that could inhibit T cell responses to virally infected cells that are present. This may be of particular relevance for older patients with COVID-19 who have severe inflammation in the respiratory tract during disease progression that may hinder antiviral immunity.

Moreover, trajectory analysis revealed gene expression changes from monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages toward M1 or M2 macrophages and identified the distinct macrophage subpopulation that had rapidly undergone SARS-CoV-2-mediated activation of inflammatory responses. Landscape analysis of the lung immune microenvironment showed dynamic changes in cell proportions and characteristics in uninfected control, at 2 days post-infection (dpi) (early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection with peak viral titer), and 5 dpi (resolution phase).

Many note that they recognize the risk but believe the benefits of vaccine acceleration are so tremendous that it is worth it to them, he says. At the same time, we feel that the public policy decisions around challenge trials will be better informed if they highlight the voice of people interested in participating in such trials. Morrison says that the people who have signed up to be part of a challenge trial tend to be young and live in urban areas, and are highly motivated to do something constructive to address the coronavirus pandemic.

This paper also confirms the previously reported findings of a higher than expected number of patients with stroke which results from the excessive stickiness of the blood in COVID-19 patients. Joint first author Dr Rachel Brown (UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and UCL Infection & Immunity) said: Our study advances understanding of the different ways in which Covid-19 can affect the brain, which will be paramount in the collective effort to support and manage patients in their treatment and recovery. Some patients in the study did not experience severe respiratory symptoms, and the neurological disorder was the first and main presentation of Covid-19.

By contrast, far-UVC light (207-222 nm) efficiently kills pathogens without harm to exposed human cells or tissues. Based on these results for the beta HCoV-OC43 coronavirus, continuous far-UVC exposure in public locations at the currently recommended exposure limit (3 mJ/cm2/hour) would result in 99.9% viral inactivation in ~ 25 minutes.

In prior analyses of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak, viral load within the nasopharynx was associated with worsened disease severity and increased mortality1,2. Background The initial dose of virus and the amount of virus an individual has at any one time might worsen the severity of COVID 19 disease. Amongst the participants hospitalized with COVID-19, we report that a higher prevalence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load is associated with worse respiratory disease severity, lower absolute lymphocyte counts, and increased markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein and IL-6. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially plasma viremia, are associated with increased risk of mortality.

In a multivariable model including estimates for age, COPD, heart disease, housing density and Black/African American race, the only variables that remained associated with positive COVID-19 testing with a probability greater than chance were the proportion of Black/African American residents and proportion of older persons. There was a nearly five-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test. During the early months of the pandemic, the report asserts that blacks were more likely to have preexisting conditions that predispose them to COVID-19 infection, less likely to have health insurance, and more likely to work in jobs that do not accommodate remote work.

The research found that if 90 percent of the Australian population adopted social distancing, the spread of COVID-19 could be controlled by July 2020, whereas social distancing of less than 70 percent would not suppress the pandemic. However, if ninety percent of the population complies, then the duration could be as short as thirteen to fourteen weeks  meaning if we began tomorrow we could expect a control of COVID-19 by July, he said. On the contrary, laxer protocols could mean a longer, more drawn out and ineffective struggle against COVID-19, he said. If social distancing measures were adopted by at least 80 percent of the Australian population, we could expect to see a control of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in just over three months, new research by the University of Sydney has found.

Health Canada will be doing a rolling review of AstraZeneca's vaccine data to make sure it meets the Department's rigorous safety and efficacy requirements. Earlier this month, the Prime Minister announced that Canada has signed an agreement with AstraZeneca to buy 20 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, should that vaccine successfully complete clinical trials and be authorized by Health Canada. Following the authorization of any vaccine submission, Health Canada will publish the evidence it reviewed in making its decision for transparency.

Sequential viral loads and deep sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from the upper respiratory tract of hospitalised children revealed that remdesivir treatment suppressed viral RNA levels in one patient but not in a second infected with an identical strain. Reduced levels of subgenomic (sg) RNA during treatment of the second patient, suggest an additional effect of remdesivir on viral replication that is independent of viral RNA levels.

For instance, the REACT survey1 suggests that overall about 5-6% of adults in England have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, but rates of infection in London is about twice this (10-11%). During the post-growth phase, the lower susceptibility of these regions contributed to the decline in cases, independent of intervention effects.

2: SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with markers of inflammation and disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially plasma viremia, are associated with increased risk of mortality. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially within plasma, are associated with systemic inflammation, disease progression, and increased risk of death. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially in the plasma, are predictive of mortality.

These results provide insight into how age and prior infection may affect T cellmediated immunity to respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 and how these factors contribute to chronic lung pathology after viral pneumonia in older individuals. Here, we report that influenza viral pneumonia leads to chronic nonresolving lung pathology and exacerbated accumulation of CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) in the respiratory tract of aged hosts.

We further validated virus neutralization microscopically by quantifying the replication of an mNeonGreen expressing clone of SARS-CoV-2 on human Caco2 cells in the presence of nanobodies over time (fig. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The structure-based multivalent nanobodies we present have strong potential clinical applications owing to increased neutralizing activity and in-built protection from rapid emergence of escape mutants.

The investigational vaccine also induced robust CD8 T-cell responses in mice. The investigators vaccinated mice with sub-protective doses of mRNA-1273 and then challenged the mice with SARS-CoV-2. Additional experiments found that mice given two injections of the 1-mcg dose and later challenged with SARS-CoV-2 virus either 5 or 13 weeks after the second injection were protected from viral replication in the lungs and nose. Importantly, mice challenged 7 weeks after only a single dose of 1 mcg or 10 mcg of mRNA-1273 were also protected against viral replication in the lung .

Our relaxed approach to social distancing is insufficient to stop the exponential growth of COVID-19. During a five-week national lockdown, federal, state and local authorities would ensure that all Americans stay home except to obtain food and other essentials, access medical care or do work essential to the functioning of society. Until Americans consistently adopt strong social distancing recommendations  a lockdown  the disease will continue to spread exponentially. The fastest and even the only way to contain COVID-19 in the United States is a five-week national lockdown.

Another previous report by Callow (4) suggested that HCoV-229E-specific antibodies in serum and nasal wash specimens were correlated with protection from experimental infection with HCoV-229E and disease, and IgA antibodies to HCoV-229E in nasal wash specimens were associated with a reduced duration of viral shedding in nasal secretions. Based on the much lower frequency of patients with HCoV-specific IgA antibody in nasal wash specimens than of those with IgG in serum in our older adult population, one might hypothesize that antibodies to HCoV in nasal secretions decline in titer more rapidly after infection than do serum antibodies or that infection does not induce IgA antibody to HCoV in nasal secretions to high titers or at all in a significant proportion of older, chronically ill patients with COPD. Hence, despite the near-universal presence of serum antibodies to the HCoV strains in our study, the lower rates of detectable IgA antibodies to HCoV suggest a possible reason for susceptibility to reinfections with HCoV, if IgA antibodies in nasal secretions are indeed protective.

These findings counsel caution in use of nasal testing in healthcare settings and contact-tracing efforts, as opposed to screening of asymptomatic, low-prevalence, low-risk populations. Those with viral loads below 1,000 copies/mL, the majority in our cohort, exhibited low concordance (Cohens kappa = 0.49); most of these would have been missed by nasal testing alone. To resolve this disagreement, we compared nasal and NP specimens collected by healthcare workers in a cohort consisting of individuals clinically suspected of COVID-19 and outpatients known to be SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive undergoing follow-up.

Analysis of antisera from immunized mice revealed that the only groups with notable neutralizing activity after a single dose of antigen were those immunized with S-Fer or SΔC-Fer (Figure 4C), underscoring that multivalent presentation greatly enhances the neutralizing antibody response in a single- dose regimen of an adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine. After a single dose, mice immunized with SΔC-Fer exhibited a significantly higher neutralizing antibody response than all nonferritin groups as determined using a spike-pseudotyped lentiviral assay. Taken together, these results provide insights into development of SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and demonstrate that spike- functionalized ferritin nanoparticles elicit an enhanced antibody response compared to the spike trimers or RBD alone.

Conclusions The detection and serial monitoring of this subset of inflammatory monocytes using flow cytometry could be of great help in guiding the prognostication and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and merits further evaluation. Findings While we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals,we did identify significant morphological and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization and ICU admission. Patients with COVID-19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter, side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry,with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high forward scatter (FSC- high). Methods We performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome.

METHODS We conducted a placebo-controlled, phase-2 clinical trial involving ambulatory COVID-19 patients. Combined metabolic cofactors supplementation (CMCS) consisting of L-serine, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), nicotinamide riboside (NR), and L-carnitine tartrate is being studied for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS In patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, CMCS resulted in a significant reduction in recovery time and liver enzymes associated with hepatic function compared to placebo.

We developed a cell line with inducible ACE2 expression to confirm that D614G more efficiently enters cells with ACE2 levels spanning the different primary cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Mounting evidence suggests D614G enhances viral entry. Using a new assay for crosslinking and directly extracting Spike trimers from the pseudovirus surface, we found an increase in trimerization efficiency and viral incorporation of D614G protomers.

Recently, a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage called B.1.1.7 has emerged in the United Kingdom that was reported to spread more efficiently than other strains. While the pseudovirus system used is a surrogate for authentic SARS-CoV-2, previous studies have shown excellent concordance between pseudotype neutralization and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays.i The preserved neutralization of the pseudovirus bearing the U.K. strain spike by BNT162b2- immune sera makes it likely that COVID-19 caused by the U.K. virus variant will also be prevented by immunization with BNT162b2. Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses bearing either the Wuhan reference strain or the B.1.1.7 lineage spike protein with sera of 16 participants in a previously reported trial with the mRNA- based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2.

We illustrate these issues using data from the UK Biobank in which individuals tested for COVID-19 are highly selected for a wide range of genetic, behavioural, cardiovascular, demographic, and anthropometric traits. Here, we highlight the challenge of interpreting observational evidence from such samples of the population, which may be affected by collider bias. We discuss the sampling mechanisms that leave aetiological studies of COVID-19 infection and progression particularly susceptible to collider bias.

JANSSENS INVESTIGATIONAL COVID-19 VACCINE CANDIDATE The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate leverages the Companys AdVac® technology platform, which was also used to develop and manufacture Janssens European Commission-approved Ebola vaccine and construct its Zika, RSV, and HIV investigational vaccine candidates. The Phase 3 ENSEMBLE and ENSEMBLE 2 trials follow positive interim results from the Companys ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical study, which is studying the safety profile and immunogenicity of both a single-dose and two-dose vaccination. In order to evaluate the efficacy of Janssens COVID-19 vaccine candidate, clinical trial sites in countries and areas with high incidence of COVID-19 and the ability to achieve a rapid initiation were selected. ENSEMBLE 2 is a complementary, planned, pivotal, large-scale, multi-country Phase 3 trial that will study the safety and efficacy of a two-dose regimen of the investigational Janssen vaccine candidate for the prevention of COVID-19 in up to 30,000 participants worldwide. PHASE 3 ENSEMBLE 2 STUDY The Phase 3 ENSEMBLE 2 study (NCT04614948) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a two-dose vaccine regimen versus placebo in adults 18 years old and older with and without comorbidities associated with an increased risk for severe COVID-19.

BACKGROUND The rapid outbreak of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the spread of the virus worldwide, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, have prompted various investigations about the impact of environmental factors on the rate of development of this epidemic. Besides, the analysis of the average air temperatures shows that the epidemic rates of COVID-19 were higher in the case studies with a lower average temperature. Conversely, if there are no significant differences in the mean daily temperature of two regions in the same country, no significant difference is observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases for these regions.

Infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 1.63% and corrected values ranged from 0.00% to 1.31%. Infection fatality rate was estimated from each study dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths at a relevant time point by the number of estimated people infected in each relevant region. Estimates of infection fatality rates inferred from seroprevalence studies tend to be much lower than original speculations made in the early days of the pandemic.

Now, researchers are trying to find out if it reacts differently in children. In the UK, younger children are testing positive at a higher rate for the new strain, according to researchers. Dr. Fuller questions if that could make children more susceptible to the virus. Experts say that could be because the new variant spreads more easily in children. Will a child who was more resistant to the old strain now be more vulnerable to infection with this new strain?

The test can be ramped up to document past and recent COVID-19 infections and possibly used to identify asymptomatic virus infection and the level of immunity in individuals. Therefore, antibodies against this domain are likely to be highly specific to SARS-CoV-2, and so these antibodies reveal if an individual has been exposed to the virus that can cause COVID-19. Our assay is extremely specific for antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19, which is not the case for some currently available antibody tests, said co-senior author Aravinda de Silva, professor of microbiology and immunology and member of the UNC Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases. The researchers, who published their work in Science Immunology, created a blood test to pinpoint SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that target one unique piece of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

These adaptive events were limited to ancestral East Asian populations, the geographical origin of several modern coronavirus epidemics. An arms race with an ancient corona-like virus may thus have taken place in ancestral East Asian populations. Here, we apply evolutionary analyses to human genomic datasets to recover selection events involving tens of human genes that interact with coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, that started 25,000 years ago. Notably, modern human genomes contain evolutionary information tracing back tens of thousands of years, which may help identify the viruses that have impacted our ancestors  pointing to which viruses have future pandemic potential.

Here we show that CRISPR- Cas9 knockout of furin reduces, but does not prevent, the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. Comparing S processing in furin knockout cells to multibasic site mutants reveals that while loss of furin substantially reduces S1-S2 cleavage it does not prevent it. Our results show that while furin promotes both SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and cell-cell spread it is not essential, suggesting furin inhibitors will not prevent viral spread. We show that loss of furin in either donor or acceptor cells reduces, but does not prevent, TMPRSS2-dependent cell-cell fusion, unlike mutation of the multibasic site that completely prevents syncytia formation.

Here we show that CRISPR- Cas9 knockout of furin reduces, but does not prevent, the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. Comparing S processing in furin knockout cells to multibasic site mutants reveals that while loss of furin substantially reduces S1-S2 cleavage it does not prevent it.

When compared with the plasma of three convalescent COVID-19 patients, sera of immunized horses displayed approximately 140-fold higher neutralizing titers measured as PRNT90. Here we demonstrate that hyperimmune globulin preparations raised in horses against the recombinant trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in the prefusion conformation provide very high ELISA titers as well as highly potent neutralizing activity against SARS- CoV-2. The high neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 obtained for the unprocessed sera were confirmed for the F(ab)2 fragments and were 150-fold higher than the PRNT90 neutralizing titers of plasma of three COVID-19 convalescent patients.

Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2.

SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and types differ by disease severity, study finds. To explore the potential relationship between virus-specific humoral responses and COVID-19 immunopathology, we measured serum antibody classes and subclasses to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the nucleoprotein in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe disease. SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and types differ by disease severity, study finds.

We showed that during the earliest phase of the global outbreak (January-March), COVID-19 growth rates were non-linearly related to climate, with fastest spread in regions with a mean temperature of ca. There is a strong relationship between local climate and Covid-19 growth rates, suggesting the possibility of seasonal variation in the spatial pattern of outbreaks, with temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere becoming at particular risk of severe outbreaks during the austral autumn-winter. We show that showed that during the earliest phase of the global outbreak (January-March), COVID-19 growth rates were non-linearly related to climate, and in the most polluted regions.

The authors conclude, Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, may be a presenting feature of COVID-19, and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms rather than waiting for respiratory symptoms to emerge. Digestive symptoms appeared to be tied to worse outcomes.

We report an important transition across the levels of social distancing compliance, in the range between 70% and 80% levels. Strong compliance with social distancing (at 80% and above) effectively controls the disease during the suppression period, while lower levels of compliance (at 70% or less) do not succeed for any duration of the suppression. This suggests that a compliance of below 70% is unlikely to succeed for any duration of social distancing, while a compliance at the 90% level is likely to control the disease within 13-14 weeks, when coupled with effective case isolation and international travel restrictions. The research found that if 90 percent of the Australian population adopted social distancing, the spread of COVID-19 could be controlled by July 2020, whereas social distancing of less than 70 percent would not suppress the pandemic. by Mihai Andrei April 7, 2020 in Health & Medicine, News, Research, Science Strong social distancing measures can curb the pandemic in 13 weeks or so -- but only if 80% of the people do it, a new study claims.

As soon as the study was published, it came under attack by clinicians, as well as experts in biostatistics and medical ethics who questioned how Surgisphere, a tiny company without much publishing experience in big data analysis, could have collected and analyzed tens of thousands of patient records from hundreds of hospitalsparticularly given the complexities of navigating patient confidentiality agreements. They have pointed out many red flags in the Lancet paper, including the astonishing number of patients and details about patient demographics and dosing that seemed implausible.

Furthermore, we report that a second dose enhances the immune response to this vaccine in aged mice, indicating that a primeboost strategy may be a rational approach to enhance immunogenicity in older persons. We find that a single dose of this vaccine induces cellular and humoral immunity in aged mice, but at a reduced magnitude than in younger adult mice.

COVID-19 ARDS was characterized by a dysregulated host response with increased PTEN signaling and elevated expression of genes with non-canonical roles in inflammation and immunity that were predicted to be modulated by dexamethasone and granulocyte colony stimulating factor. In contrast to a cytokine storm, we observed reduced proinflammatory gene expression in COVID-19 ARDS when compared to ARDS due to other causes. COVID-19 ARDS is characterized by a dysregulated host response that differs from cytokine In summary, assessment of host gene expression in the lower airways of patients with COVID-19 ARDS did not demonstrate cytokine storm but instead revealed a unique and dysregulated host response predicted to be modified by dexamethasone.

Facebooks call to cancel its conference because of the virus is an amplified example of how coronavirus fears are impacting day-to-day business in the tech industry. Facebook canceling its global marketing conference comes on the heels of this weeks cancellation of Mobile World Congress, also due to coronavirus concerns. But the Facebook marketing summit is the first publicly reported example of an event in the San Francisco Bay Area being canceled due to the virus. Out of an abundance of caution, we canceled our Global Marketing Summit due to evolving public health risks related to coronavirus, Anthony Harrison, a Facebook spokesman, said by email. Facebook is canceling an annual conference held in San Francisco out of health concerns regarding the coronavirus.

Like SARS-CoV-2, some other viruses, such as Epstein-Barr, can damage heart tissue, for example. For patients with cardiac insufficiency who have underlying heart disease, SARS-CoV-2 infection might act as a precipitating factor to worsen the condition and lead to death. And while SARS-CoV-2 may lead to overt cardiac symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath resulting in heart attacks and blood clots, there is also the possibility that the virus may cause significant heart damage and inflammationbut without producing any immediate or more noticeable cardiac symptoms.

We are in agreement with the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, which states that if the government wished to move away from the WHO regulation and its own previous regulation, which permitted both cremation and burial, the government should have consulted leaders of the Muslim community including medical professionals and scientists of the faith, said the NPC. Ahmed Shaheed, UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief, has urged the Sri Lankan government to respect Islamic burial rights and stop hate speech against Muslims. Lakmal said there is no scientific evidence to support the conclusion that cremation is safer than burial to avoid infection from COVID-19. All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama said that a Muslim who dies from COVID-19 should have the option of being buried, in line with WHO guidelines and as implemented in more than 180 countries, since it is an integral part of Islam and a religious obligation of the community towards the deceased. Two Catholics, Oshala Lakmal and Ranmal Anthony Amerasinghe, filed separate fundamental rights violation petitions in the Supreme Court challenging the gazette notification that the bodies of those who are confirmed or suspected COVID-19 victims should be cremated within 24 hours, preferably within 12 hours.

Such tests cost as little as $1 to $2 each, give a yes/no readout within minutes, much like a pregnancy test, and are already used to detect influenza, HIV, and other viruses. By making it possible to identify and isolate infected individuals more quickly, proponents say, the shift would slow the virus' spread, key to safely reopening schools, factories, and offices.

A nasally administered trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is well tolerated, stimulates both mucosal and systemic immunity, and potentially protects against influenza illness. Superior relative efficacy of live attenuated influenza vaccine compared with inactivated influenza vaccine in young children with recurrent respiratory tract infections. Being protected against influenza, TIV recipients may lack temporary non-specific immunity that protected against other respiratory viruses.

Convalescent patients had elevated circulating endothelial cells (CECs), and those with underlying cardiovascular risk had more pronounced endothelial activation hallmarks (ICAM1, P-selectin or CX3CL1) expressed by CECs. Several proinflammatory and activated T lymphocyte-associated cytokines correlated positively with CEC measures, implicating cytokine-driven endothelial dysfunction.

Joining the flood of press releases announcing positive results from COVID-19 vaccine trials, developers of Russias Sputnik V vaccine today reported 91.4% efficacy from a second interim analysis of more than 18,000 people, bolstering a claim the team made on 11 November with scant evidence.

Stanford doctors on Friday protested the system's vaccine rollout plan, as multiple hospitals come under fire for giving too many doses to staff who aren't on the front line, according to reports from San Francisco Chronicle. Jose M. Osorio/Chicago Tribune via AP Doctors protested at Stanford Medical Center Friday, saying the hospital failed to prioritize vaccines for front-line workers and instead gave too many to office staff and others working from home. In a statement, a representative for Stanford Medical said it took complete responsibility for issues with the vaccine's rollout. In Stanford's case, the hospital's chief medical officer, Dr. Niraj Sehgal, apologized to staff this week for unintended missteps in vaccine rollout, according to a screenshot of the email shared on Twitter.

Thus, CD4-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection of T helper cells may explain the poor adaptive immune response of many COVID- 19 patients. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infects human CD4+ T helper cells, but not CD8+ T cells, and is present in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage T helper cells of severe COVID-19 patients. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) directly binds to the CD4 molecule, which in turn mediates the entry of SARS- CoV-2 in T helper cells in a mechanism that also requires ACE2 and TMPRSS2.

Conclusions Detecting antibody responses in both saliva and serum is optimal for determining virus exposure and understanding immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-spike, but not nucleocapsid, IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses were readily detectable in saliva from non-hospitalized symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Antibody responses in saliva and serum were largely independent of each other and symptom reporting.

COVID-19 and MIS attack rates, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies titres were not significantly impacted by prior seasonal coronavirus infection. Interpretation Prior infection with HCoVs does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and related MIS in children. The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was not significantly different in children who had prior seasonal coronavirus infection. Evidence before this study Children seem to be less likely affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical course of COVID-19 is less severe than in adults.

Interestingly, extension of SARS-CoV2 ORF3b by removal of a premature stop codon enhances its ability to antagonise IFN-β induction. Finally, SARS-CoV2 isolates from two severe COVID-19 cases were shown to express the extended ORF3b which shows increased IFN-β antagonism. A natural elongation variant of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b isolated from two patients showed a stronger suppression of interferon induction than wildtype SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b. They find the truncated ORF3b encoded by SARS-CoV-2 (22 aa) suppresses IFN-β induction more efficiently than the full-length SARS-CoV ortholog (~153 aa).

The question of whether earlier lopinavirritonavir treatment in Covid-19 could have clinical benefit is an important one that requires further study. A recent report showed that the median duration of viral shedding in Covid-19 was 20 days in patients with severe illness and could be as long as 37 days.24 Neither that study nor the current one found evidence that lopinavirritonavir exerted a significant antiviral effect.

Main outcomes: Population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 by borough and correlation with the reduction in daily commuting-style movements into and out of each borough. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by New York City borough between March 22nd and May 3rd, 2020, and to associate variation in prevalence with antecedent reductions in mobility, defined as aggregated daily physical movements into and out of each borough. Conclusions and relevance: Reductions in between-borough mobility predict geographic differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in New York City.

They found that death rates dropped for all groups, even older patients by 18 percentage points on average. The BBC previously reported this fall in the death rate among patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus, when University of Oxford researchers estimated it had fallen from 6% to 1.5% between the peak in April and June. University of Oxford researchers found the proportion of coronavirus patients dying each day in England fell from 6% to 1.5% between April and June. The proportion of patients admitted to critical care who die fell by almost a quarter from the peak and as much as half in hospitals overall. Based on a much smaller number of patients admitted between the 1 September and the start of October, the death rate now appears to be about a quarter of that level.

Corticosteroids have primarily been thought about in COVID-19 as a means to stave off the 'cytokine storm and its consequences like ARDS, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypotension, shock and death. Cytokine storm induction by SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in COVID-19 patients at the intensive care unit (ICU), and elevated plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines have been associated with disease severity and prognosis [7, 8].

If 100% of people wear masks (or 60% wear masks that are 80% effective), this decreases the CAR by 38%, the peak prevalence by 67%, and the population mortality by 40%. Results: If 60% of the population wears masks that are 50% effective, this decreases the cumulative infection attack rate (CAR) by 25%, the peak prevalence by 51%, and the population mortality by 25%. We evaluated scenarios where wearing a mask reduces transmission and susceptibility by 50% or 80%; an individual wears a mask with a probability of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, or 100%.

1 Vaccination of rhesus macaques with ChAdOx1 MERS elicits a humoral immune response. Animals that received a vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS, either via a prime-boost or prime-only regimen, had either no lesions or limited small multifocal areas of consolidation and congestion. In conclusion, we show that a single vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS results in protection against disease progression and virus replication associated with MERS-CoV challenge in the rhesus macaque, and a prime-boost regimen reduced viral replication further. In the current manuscript, we show that a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine protects rhesus macaque model against a mucosal challenge with HCoV-EMC/2012.

Animals that received a vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS, either via a prime-boost or prime-only regimen, had either no lesions or limited small multifocal areas of consolidation and congestion. In conclusion, we show that a single vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS results in protection against disease progression and virus replication associated with MERS-CoV challenge in the rhesus macaque, and a prime-boost regimen reduced viral replication further. In the current manuscript, we show that a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine protects rhesus macaque model against a mucosal challenge with HCoV-EMC/2012.
[The report] surely includes some new data, but the general findingthat comorbidities increase your risk of dying from COVID-19is not a surprise at all, Lessler has said. Lessler is an infectious disease specialist at the Bloomberg School of Public Health and was interviewed by John Hopkins publication Hub and clarified the recent CDC report:  The importance of this CDC data is showing the comorbidities in people who have died with COVID-19, in hopes of better understanding the risk factors for death.

Others argue that a range of anthropogenic environmental degradations have played a vital role in the emergence of SARS- CoV-2 and other zoonoses. In this opinion piece, I argue that these divergent viewpoints stem, in part, from different foundational conceptual frameworks  biomedical individualist and eco-social frameworks, respectively. Based on the fact that the eco-social framework provides a more complete account of the different types of causal factors underpinning the emergence of zoonoses, I propose that the COVID-19 pandemic provides an additional reason for the health sciences to ground its theory of health and disease in an eco-social conceptual framework.

But scientists also need to test a persons blood for antibodies to the new virus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Widespread antibody testing could also provide key data for efforts to model the course of the pandemic.

Results of this critical appraisal reveal information bias and selection bias in coronavirus mortality overestimation, most likely caused by misclassifying an influenza infection fatality rate as a case fatality rate. Reference James45 For example, the publics belief that mitigation measures were responsible for reducing coronavirus mortality may be a post hoc fallacy if lower mortality was actually due to the overestimation of coronavirus deaths.

Patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 may have alterations in the oral and gut microbiota, while oral species have been found in the lung of COVID-19 patients. Conversely, the oropharyngeal microbiota in patients after lung transplantation showed severe dysbiosis community-wise with reduction of diversity and richness increasing anaerobic facultative bacteria. SARS-Cov2 enables anaerobic bacteria (Prevotella, et al) to colonize the lungs disrupting homeostasis, causing long-drawn chronic symptoms, and acute severe symptoms (ARDS, septic shock, clots, arterial stroke) which finds resonance, with key differences, in the forgotten disease Lemierre Syndrome, enabled by Epstein Barr Virus. In disease, we found lung abnormalities related to oral microbiome dysbiosis, suggesting the oral cavity as the microbial gateway for the lower respiratory tract [52].

Conclusions It is plausible that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19 and promote superspreading events. Our findings are also consistent with the declining incidence of COVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in closed environments was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease.

Based on our data we were able to develop a score to predict fatal outcomes and to identify patients that may benefit from strategies to overcome T cell anergy. We applied novel approaches to analyze T cell reactivity and showed that T anergy is already present in non-ventilated COVID-19 patients, very pronounced in ventilated patients, strongly associated with virus persistence and reversible with clinical recovery. Downstream markers of T cell anergy were also found in fresh blood samples of critically ill patients with severe T cell anergy.

This study provides vital information on the extent of virus spread in a country where social distancing is in place, concluding that herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is not a realistic short-term exit strategy option. The herd immunity in the case of an epidemic with a pathogen with potential fatal outcome is not achievable because it's essential mechanism, randomisation of immunised (R) within a society is not achievable.

Breastfeeding may protect against the horizontal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as specific antibodies against this virus have been found in the breast milk of a COVID-19-infected mother.18 This hypothesis appears consistent with the protective effect of breastfeeding against respiratory tract infections in infancy.19 Our results support early postnatal proximity, despite many mothers worldwide being separated from their newborn infants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their newborns are at a higher risk of prematurity and early separation from their mothers, who may subsequently require intensive care for their own health.1,2 Although neonates born of mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy are seemingly vulnerable to infection, studies have found that they were not at a high risk for severe infection and were very rarely affected by COVID-19.1,2,3,4,5,6 The presence of virus by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been reported in newborns before H 12 of life.1 In addition, antiviral immunoglobulin M has been detected in newborns at birth,7 suggesting that mother-to-infant viral transmission may occur.8 To date, however, only one case of vertical transmission has been clearly demonstrated.9 In several cases of early neonatal infection, postnatal contamination cannot be excluded.10 Moreover, only one case report found that the virus could pass from mother to infant through the mothers breast milk.11 Despite these findings, international or national guidelines on the management of newborns of mothers suspected or positive for COVID-19, including Chinese consensus guidelines and guidelines of the American Academic of Pediatrics, have recommended at least temporary separation of mother and newborn as a precaution.12,13 In contrast, other guidelines,14 including those of the French Society of Neonatology,15,16 do not recommend systematic separation.

Conclusion Patients recovered from severe COVID-19 present low cardiorespiratory fitness, activate glycolytic fibers at low power outputs, and show low neuromuscular efficiency; while patients recovered from mild COVID-19 do not present these sequels. Chronic pain following COVID-19: implications for rehabilitation. It is envisaged that an additional requirement for these procedures will emerge from requests to evaluate individuals recovering from severe COVID-19 infection.7 In this context, measurements obtained from an assessment of cardiorespiratory responses to physiological stress could provide insight regarding the integrity of the pulmonary-vascular interface and characterisation of any impairment or abnormal cardiorespiratory function.

Figure 1 available in the PDF version Enhanced hygiene and social distancing measures may reduce both numbers of cases and severity of cases through several mechanisms We suggest that a pre-emptive implementation of low cost interventions prior to detection, but in imminent expectation of community transmission should be considered because it may decrease both the total numbers of cases and severity of cases. Pre-emptive, low cost, hygiene enhancement and social distancing in the context of imminent community transmission of novel coronavirus COVID-19 should be considered. These low cost enhanced hygiene and physical distancing measures are applicable preemptively before confirmation of local community transmission or where transmission of SARSCoV2 appears to be under control. Hygiene measures mostly act on the second factor, as they reduce the risk of transmission if a contact occurs. Here we explore whether low cost pre-emptive enhanced hygiene and social distancing should be implemented prior to confirmation of community transmission in countries without, or with minimal, confirmed person-to-person transmission of COVID-19.

Appropriate messaging surrounding the announcement of lockdowns and measures to decrease unnecessary travel are important for preventing these unintended consequences of lockdowns. We find that travel surges following announcements of lockdowns can increase seeding of the epidemic in rural areas, undermining the goal of the lockdown of preventing disease spread.

But I am surprised you didnt mention the recent preprint from NYU about HCQ and zinc significantly decreasing mortality by 44%. Yohanan Weininger says: 20 May, 2020 at 4:46 am heh Mike R, Your post is empty without reference, link to the recent preprint from NYU about HCQ and zinc significantly decreasing mortality by 44%. You are leaving out a big part of the picture when you leave out the hydroxychloroquine and zinc interaction and leave out the well done retrospective study that suggested HCQ/zinc saved 44% almost twice the number of lives than compared to HCQ alone.

In fact, virtual enrollment of the phase 2 study where interested individuals can sign up via a QR code has already started, putting CanSino ahead of all the others on a long list of COVID-19 vaccine developers. (CanSino) In the global race to develop an effective vaccine to protect people against the novel coronavirus, Chinas CanSino Bio has leapt ahead. CanSino and its collaborators at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences Institute of Biotechnology plan to move their adenovirus type-5 vector-based recombinant COVID-19 vaccine, Ad5-nCoV, into phase 2 clinical trial in China soon, the company said in a disclosure (PDF) to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Thursday.

On the other hand, the Liverpool interactions group has provided prescribing resources where they categorized the interactions of experimental COVID-19 antiviral therapies as contraindicated medications, potential interactions requiring dose adjustment/close monitoring, potential interactions of weak intensity or no clinically significant interactions (University of Liverpool, 2020). The Liverpool Drug Interaction Group, based at the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom, worked in collaboration with other research teams to gather data on a wide variety of drugs, and create a set of recommendations about potential drug interactions.

Patients with active or latent TB were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and COVID-19 symptom development and progression were more rapid and severe. Findings In this observational case-control study of 36 COVID-19 cases from Shenyang, China, we found tuberculosis history (both of active TB and latent TB) to be an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Meaning Tuberculosis status should be assessed carefully at patient admission and management and therapeutic strategies adjusted accordingly to prevent rapid development of severe COVID-19 complications.

We recently identified activation of an autoimmune-prone B cell response pathway as correlate of severe COVID-19, raising the possibility of de novo autoreactive antibody production during the antiviral response. Here, we identify autoreactive antibodies as a common feature of severe COVID-19, identifying biomarkers of tolerance breaks that may indicate aggressive immunomodulation.

Many researchers say pursuing herd immunity is a bad idea. And because variables can change, including R 0 and the number of people susceptible to a virus, herd immunity is not a steady state. Attempting to reach herd immunity via targeted infections is simply ludicrous, Andersen says. GRETA BAUER: If that were the situation, then there's no potential to develop a level of herd immunity sufficient to stop the infection.

In SinoPharm's case, they inactivated the coronavirus with beta-propiolactone, which is a classic protein-alkylating compound. (wildpixel/GettyImages) Sinopharm has published clinical data on its adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2inactivated virus vaccine. On Monday, Nasdaq-listed Sinovac said its inactivated vaccine, called CoronaVac, induced neutralizing antibodies in over 90% of the 600 healthy volunteers in the phase 2 part of a phase 1/2 study.

Experts have reached no firm consensus on whether vitamin D can help prevent MS given the lack of clinical trial evidence. In contrast to the observational studies, clinical trials have provided little support for the hypothesis that supplemental vitamin D reduces the risk of CVD or CVD mortality. Finally, NICE may be unlikely to recommend vitamin D supplementation on the basis of a trial that has no clear placebo arm. No studies have examined whether such screening for vitamin D deficiency results in improved health outcomes. However, clinical trials do not support a cause-and-effect relationship between vitamin D and weight loss.

The minimal diversity found among SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be explained by drift and bottleneck events as the virus spread away from its original epicenter in Wuhan, China. Our findings suggest that a single vaccine should be efficacious against current global strains.

The crystal structure of COR-101 in complex with SARS-CoV-2-RBD was solved at 2.0 A resolution showing that the antibody binds at the same region as the human coronavirus receptor ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2-RBD. The best antibody currently is in production to be clinically tested soon as immunotherapy to treat acute COVID-19. A large set of more than 750 human monoclonal antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV2 Spike (S) protein isolated by antibody phage display from human antibody libraries from healthy donors and convalescent COVID-19 patients underwent a fast track development process to identify lead molecule with optimal drug features for a passive vaccine. Here we report the isolation of two specific human monoclonal antibodies (termed CA1 and CB6) from a patient convalescing from COVID-19.

Case mortality rates declined consistently and significantly over the course of the four intervals: 57% among those aged 50-59 years; 62% among those aged 60-69 years; 52% among those aged 70-79 years; and 34% among those aged 80 or more years. During the fourth interval, an apparent rise in mortality among hospitalized patients in the same age group was mirrored by a significant decline in mortality among those not hospitalized.

In Arizona, wastewater from a student dormitory contained viral RNA just days after studentswho had all tested negative for COVID-19moved into their rooms this month. 28, 2020 , 2:40 PM By testing dorm wastewater for the coronavirus, the University of Arizona may have stomped out a potential outbreak before it could spread, The Washington Post reports. The university retested all 311 residents and dorm workers and found two students who were asymptomatic but positive for the virus; they were then quarantined, officials explained in a press conference.

Robust immune responses with spike-specific neutralizing antibodies, memory B cells and circulating TFH cells have been found in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 infection8. Humoral and circulating follicular helper T cell responses in recovered patients with COVID-19. Here, we discuss our current understanding of the relative contribution of B cells and T cells to immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and the implications for the development of effective treatments and vaccines for COVID-19. These T cells are probably cross-reactive with other HCoVs, but whether they can provide protection from COVID-19 disease remains to be determined.

Why health care workers might refuse vaccination Fewer than half of the hospital workers at St. Elizabeth Community Hospital in Tehama County, Calif., were willing to be vaccinated, and around 20% to 40% of L.A. County's frontline workers have reportedly declined an opportunity to take the vaccine. While 27% of the public is vaccine hesitant -- saying they probably or definitely would not get a COVID-19 vaccine -- 29% of health care workers said the same, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey. Mike DeWine said he was troubled by the relatively low numbers of nursing home workers who have elected to take the vaccine, with DeWine stating that approximately 60% of nursing home staff declined the shot.

As some of these drugs, mostly antibiotics, were already empirically used in the treatment of COVID-19, we encourage our colleagues all over the world to publish patient data so potential efficacy of these agents can be evaluated in the clinical context and rapidly implemented in the therapeutic protocols if the beneficial effect on clinical outcome is observed. The main mechanism of action responsible for the favourable outcome of COVID-19 patients treated with CQ seems to be related to pH modulation- mediated effect on the endolysosomal trafficking, a characteristic of chemical compounds often called lysosomotropic agents because of the physico-chemical properties that enable them to passively diffuse through the endosomal membrane and undergo protonation-based trapping in the lumen of the acidic vesicles.

The findings revealed that the person having O blood type were less susceptible towards SARS-CoV infection in comparison with those having other blood types. The ABO gene stands out among the genes involved since O blood group individuals were shown to have very low odds of infection compared to non-O individuals in a hospital outbreak that occurred in March 2003 in Hong Kong (Cheng et al. Epidemiological analysis of a hospital outbreak in Hong Kong revealed that blood group O was associated with a low risk of infection. Yet, it is precisely what was observed in the case of a hospital outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, where O blood group individuals appeared at a much lower risk of being infected by SARS-CoV than subjects of other blood types (Cheng et al.

COVID-19 has now struck mink farms in the United States, too. Mink on each farm were most likely initially infected via transmission of the virus from farm workers with COVID-19. Mink can be infected by people with COVID-19, and evidence to date suggests mink-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is plausible. The Dutch government reported multiple cases of transmission from mink to farm staff, and several staffers on the Utah farms who came in contact with the mink have confirmed COVID-19.

In addition to the rate of compliance and false negatives, the required rate of testing is dependent on the design of the testing regime, with concurrent testing outperforming random sampling of individuals. We show here that at a sufficient rate of testing and isolation, the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 would be reduced well below 1.0, and the epidemic would collapse. It would also be robust to failure, as even in the case where the testing rate would be insufficient to collapse the epidemic, it would still reduce the number of infected individuals in the population, improving both public health and economic conditions.

One third of the effect happened already on average 6 days before the lockdown, with lockdown itself causing another major drop in transmission. During lockdown, decreased mobility in retail and recreation was an independent predictor of lower R t during lockdown, while changes in other types of mobility were not. Our data suggest measures that will contribute to avoiding a second peak include a tight control on circumstances that facilitate massive spread such as large gatherings especially indoors, physical distancing, and mask use.

Here, we identified non-synonymous mutations in MHC-I restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes after deep sequencing of 747 SARS-CoV- 2 virus isolates. Our findings highlight the capacity of SARS- CoV-2 to subvert CD8+ T cell surveillance through escape mutations in MHCI- restricted viral epitopes. The findings of this current study show that effector T cells may give rise to SARS-CoV-2 mutations which escape immune surveillance.

A more than 90% effective coronavirus vaccine would be roughly on par with one dose of a measles vaccination, which is about 93% effective, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The company said that the analysis found that the vaccine was more than 90 percent effective in preventing the disease among trial volunteers who had no evidence of prior coronavirus infection. The news comes a week after Pfizer and BioNTech said their vaccine was more than 90% effective.

Nevertheless, mechanistic studies found that surgical masks could prevent transmission of human coronavirus and influenza virus infections if worn by infected persons ( 2). However, as with hand hygiene, face masks might be able to reduce the transmission of other infections and therefore have value in an influenza pandemic when healthcare resources are stretched. In addition, persons caring for ill family members at home (e.g., a parent of a child exhibiting influenza symptoms) might use face masks to avoid infection when in close contact with a patient, just as health care personnel wear masks in health care settings.

To estimate relative transmission parameters, we employ a discrete stochastic model of the spread of infection within a household, allowing for susceptibility and infectivity parameters to differ among children and adults. To address this and adjust our analysis accordingly, we used the serological data to estimate under-detection rates in children and adults, and have then used these estimated rates to repeat our previous fitting of the household model to the data, while performing multiple imputations in the PCR testing data, imputing a fraction of the PCR-negative cases as infected. In this study we estimate susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to those of adults using households data. This study uses data on infections within households in order to estimate the susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to those of adults.

Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 and its closest relatives from bats show the strongest CpG suppression among all known human and bat coronaviruses, respectively. Thus, our results identify ZAP as an effector of the IFN response against SARS-CoV-2, although this pandemic pathogen may be preadapted to the low CpG environment in humans. Type I, II and III IFNs all strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 and further induced ZAP expression. Here, we show that Zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) that specifically targets CpG dinucleotides in viral RNA sequences restricts SARS-CoV-2.

Dogs are also able to identify Covid-19 from a much smaller molecular sample than PCR tests, Helsinki airport said, needing only 10-100 molecules to detect the presence of the virus compared with the 18m needed by laboratory equipment. A dog is capable of detecting the presence of the coronavirus within 10 seconds and the entire process takes less than a minute to complete, according to Anna Hielm-Björkman of the University of Helsinki, who is overseeing the trial. Researchers in countries including Australia, France, Germany and Britain are reportedly working on similar projects but Finland is the first country in Europe to put dogs to work sniffing out the coronavirus.

I dont want to draw sweeping conclusions from a small study, but this preliminary glimpse into how COVID-19 might cause changes in the placenta carries some pretty significant implications for the health of a pregnancy. The placentas from 16 women who tested positive for COVID-19 while pregnant showed evidence of injury, according to pathological exams completed directly following birth, reports a new Northwestern Medicine study. The type of injury seen in the placentas shows abnormal blood flow between the mothers and their babies in utero, pointing to a new complication of COVID-19.

The type of injury seen in the placentas shows abnormal blood flow between the mothers and their babies in utero, pointing to a new complication of COVID-19.

We look forward to the upcoming Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee discussion and continue to work closely with the FDA and regulatory authorities worldwide to secure authorization of our vaccine candidate as quickly as possible. Filing for Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S. is a critical step in making our vaccine candidate available to the global population as quickly as possible, said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. These forward-looking statements may include, but may not be limited to, statements concerning: BioNTechs efforts to combat COVID-19; the collaboration between BioNTech and Pfizer to develop a potential COVID-19 vaccine; our expectations regarding the potential characteristics of BNT162b2 in our Phase 2/3 trial and/or in commercial use based on data observations to date; the expected timepoint for additional readouts on efficacy data of BNT162b2 in our Phase 2/3 trial; the nature of the clinical data, which is subject to ongoing peer review, regulatory review and market interpretation; the timing for submission of data for, or receipt of, any marketing approval or Emergency Use Authorization; the timing for submission of manufacturing data to the FDA; our contemplated shipping and storage plan, including our estimated product shelflife at various temperatures; and the ability of BioNTech to supply the quantities of BNT162 to support clinical development and, if approved, market demand, including our production estimates for 2020 and 2021. From the start of the research program earlier this year, Pfizer and BioNTech have successfully supplied and distributed their investigational vaccine to more than 150 clinical trial sites across the U.S., as well as Europe, Latin America, and South Africa. This release contains forward-looking information about Pfizers efforts to combat COVID-19, the collaboration between BioNTech and Pfizer to develop a potential COVID-19 vaccine, the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program and modRNA candidate BNT162b2 (including qualitative assessments of available data, potential benefits, expectations for clinical trials, the submission of a request for Emergency Use Authorization and other regulatory submissions, the anticipated timing of regulatory submissions, regulatory approval or authorization and anticipated manufacturing, distribution and supply), that involves substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.

An updated summary of todays key events: More than 100,000 Americans are now hospitalized with Covid-19, the highest number yet during the pandemic, and nearly double the number during earlier waves of the pandemic in April and July. This is the highest number yet recorded, and nearly twice as many people as were hospitalized at the peak of earlier coronavirus waves in April and July.

Furthermore, age, race/ethnicity, and blood group stratified analyses reveal significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 rate among black individuals who have taken the PCV13 vaccine, with relative risk of 0.45 at the 5 year time horizon (n: 653, 95% CI: (0.32, 0.64), p-value: 6.9e-05). We find that polio, Hemophilus influenzae type-B (HIB), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), varicella, pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13), geriatric flu, and hepatitis A / hepatitis B (HepA-HepB) vaccines administered in the past 1, 2, and 5 years are associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, even after adjusting for geographic SARS-CoV-2 incidence and testing rates, demographics, comorbidities, and number of other vaccinations. These findings suggest that additional pre-clinical and clinical studies are warranted to assess the protective effects of existing non-COVID-19 vaccines and explore underlying immunologic mechanisms.

However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smokers lung compared to non-smokers lung. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers.

However, compared to healthy controls, the percentages and absolute numbers of both NK cells and CD8+ T cells were significantly reduced, accompanied with decreased IFNg expression in CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood from severe patients. Our work thus indicates that COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms are associated with defective cellular immunity, which not only provides insights on understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, but also has implications in developing an effective vaccine to SARS-CoV-2. Currently, though convalescent individuals have been shown with both cellular and humoral immune responses, there is very limited understanding on the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses, in patients with severe COVID-19. Most notably, we failed in detecting SARS-CoV-2-specific IFNg production by peripheral blood lymphocytes from these patients.

However, and importantly, lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory compartments, reduced gross and histopathological lesion severity in the lungs, and reductions in several parameters associated with coagulation and inflammatory processes were observed in monkeys that received convalescent sera versus untreated controls. Groups of SARS- CoV-2-infected animals were treated with pooled convalescent sera containing either high or low to moderate anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers.

Most asymptomatic COVID-19 cases showed strong T cell responses even if only 60% of these individuals were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. Two studies in this issue of Cell collectively suggest that, although SARS-CoV-2 infection may blunt long-lived antibody responses, immune memory might still be achieved through virus-specific memory T cells.

These talent programs seek to lure Chinese overseas talent and foreign experts to bring their knowledge and experience to China and reward individuals for stealing proprietary information. In November 2018, NIH inquired of Harvard whether Lieber had failed to disclose his then-suspected relationship with WUT and Chinas Thousand Talents Plan. Lieber caused Harvard to falsely tell NIH that Lieber had no formal association with WUT after 2012, that WUT continued to falsely exaggerate his involvement with WUT in subsequent years, and that Lieber is not and has never been a participant in Chinas Thousand Talents Plan. During the interview, it is alleged that Ye falsely claimed that she had minimal contact with two NUDT professors who were high-ranking PLA officers.

Cell and animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to transcriptional and serum profiling of COVID-19 patients, consistently revealed a unique and inappropriate inflammatory response. We propose that reduced innate antiviral defenses coupled with exuberant inflammatory cytokine production are the defining and driving features of COVID-19.

Collectively, our data demonstrate that brilacidin exerts potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and thus supports brilacidin as a promising COVID-19 drug candidate. We demonstrate that brilacidin, a synthetic small molecule with peptide-like properties, is capable of exerting potent in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, both as a standalone treatment and in combination with remdesivir, which is currently the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Brilacidin and remdesivir exhibit excellent synergistic activity against SARS-CoV-2.

Brilacidin and remdesivir exhibit excellent synergistic activity against SARS-CoV-2.
The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97%, based on positive RT-PCR results. Compared to RT-PCR, chest CT imaging may be a more reliable, practical and rapid method to diagnose and assess COVID-19, especially in the epidemic area, the authors wrote. The researchers concluded that CT should be used as the primary screening tool for COVID-19. Recent research found that the sensitivity of CT for COVID-19 infection was 98% compared to RT-PCR sensitivity of 71%.

At the time of publication, New Zealand had recorded fewer than 1500 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and 20 deaths. New Zealand recorded its first day of no new cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) early this week, more than a month after its strict lockdown began. Michael Baker, professor at the University of Otago's department of public health in Wellington, who has been advising the New Zealand Government on its response, said implementing a full lockdowninvolving the closure of schools and non-essential workplaces, a ban on social gatherings, and severe travel restrictionsenabled the country to consider elimination.

Stronger responses could be elicited consistently from existing vaccines by simply using sleep to make them more effective. This research could pave the way for new vaccination strategies, in which patients are immunized at particular times of day, and when they can be sure of getting a good nights sleep. Sleep enhances the human antibody response to hepatitis A vaccination. The sleep-induced promotion of Th cell proliferation and the shift of the Th1/Th2 balance towards Th1 cytokines during early SWS-rich sleep likely represent further components of the immuno-enhancing influence of sleep after vaccination. Thus, sleep after vaccination can enhance the subsequent adaptive immune response like an adjuvant (see below).

Ruxolitinib can be a therapeutic option for patients with respiratory insufficiency in COVID-19 related ARDS. Despite the limited number of patients collected, the results obtained are encouraging and indicate ruxolitinib as a potential therapeutic option for patients with severe COVID-19 related respiratory insufficiency. Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that immune- modulation with ruxolitinib might have been beneficial in reducing severity of ARDS in the context of COVID-19.

Methods Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and risk factors for poor outcomes were treated with lenzilumab 600 mg intravenously for three doses through an emergency single-use IND application. Conclusions In high-risk COVID-19 patients with severe and critical pneumonia, GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab was safe and associated with improved clinical outcomes, oxygen requirement, and cytokine storm. With this rationale, we used lenzilumab, an anti-human GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, to treat patients with severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Lenzilumab was supplied by Humanigen, Inc. for the compassionate use treatment of COVID-19 subjects by investigators at the Mayo Clinics.

More than two-thirds of residents and staff members had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of their nasal swab RT-PCR positivity or symptoms status. Methods: Residents and staff had a convalescent blood sample for SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and neutralising antibodies by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR five weeks after the primary COVID-19 outbreak investigation. Conclusions: RT-PCR testing for SARS- CoV-2 significantly underestimates the true extent of an outbreak in institutional settings.

The selection of ACE2 variants for high binding signal therefore reports not only on affinity, but also on presentation at the membrane of folded structure recognized by SARS-CoV-2 S. Whether these mutations selectively stabilize a virus-recognized local structure in ACE2 versus the global protein fold is unclear.

Therefore, molecular entities able to interfere with binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to ACE2 have a great potential to inhibit viral entry. Starting from the available structural data on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor, we here engineered a mini-protein with the aim of creating a soluble and stable Spike interactor. By plugging the Spike protein, our mini-protein constitutes a valid tool for the development of treatments against different types of coronavirus. This mini-protein, which was recombinantly produced in high yields, possesses a stable α helical conformation and is able to interact with the RBD of glycosylated Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 with nanomolar affinity, as measured by microscale thermophoresis. Like other coronaviruses, this novel virus relies on the surface Spike glycoprotein to access the host cells, mainly through the interaction of its Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) with the human angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

By plugging the Spike protein, our mini-protein constitutes a valid tool for the development of treatments against different types of coronavirus. This mini-protein, which was recombinantly produced in high yields, possesses a stable α helical conformation and is able to interact with the RBD of glycosylated Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 with nanomolar affinity, as measured by microscale thermophoresis. Like other coronaviruses, this novel virus relies on the surface Spike glycoprotein to access the host cells, mainly through the interaction of its Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) with the human angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

If there is a confirmed case of COVID-19, Public Health will work with the school and the district to determine the best measures including potential closure of the school. Taking these measures can help reduce the number of workers who come into contact with COVID-19 and help minimize absenteeism due to illness If you can feasibly avoid bringing large groups of people together, consider postponing events and gatherings. This is a critical moment in the growing outbreak of COVID-19 in King County and these measures can potentially impact the spread of the disease.

Thus, it was crucial to investigate how the virus could enter heart cells, by mapping the location of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor in the heart, and the proteases that enable the virus to gain entry to cells. This makes these cells the most likely initial infection route for the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus requires two key proteins, called ACE2 and TMPRSS2, to enter human cells.

In addition, it skips the need for swab sampling, decreases the risk of the healthcare personnel involved in this process, and accelerates the diagnostic procedure. Here, we show that saliva samples treated with a lysis buffer can serve as a suitable source for viral RNA detection, that is cheaper and can be as efficient as the classical protocol that involves column purification of the viral RNA. Detection of the viral genome through RT-qPCR is the golden standard for this test, however, the high demand of the materials and reagents needed to sample individuals, purify the viral RNA, and perform the RT-qPCR test has resulted in a worldwide shortage of several of these supplies.

Most prominent among these is the D614G amino acid substitution in the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein, which mediates viral entry. These results are consistent with the possibility that the Spike D614G mutant increases the infectivity of SARS- CoV2. Here, we synthesized and expressed the WT and D614G variant SARS-Cov2 Spike protein, and report that using a SARS-CoV2 Spike protein pseudotyped lentiviral vector we observe that the D614G variant Spike has >1/2 log10 increased infectivity in human cells expressing the human ACE2 protein as the viral receptor. The increased binding/fusion activity of the D614G Spike protein was corroborated in a cell fusion assay using Spike and ACE2 proteins expressed in different cells.

Discussions and Conclusions Long-term exposure to NO2, which largely arises from urban combustion sources such as traffic, may enhance susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes, independent of longterm PM2.5 and O3 exposure. While the risk factors of COVID-19 are still under investigation, environmental factors, such as urban air pollution, may play an important role in increasing population susceptibility to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Moreover, continuation of current efforts to lower traffic emissions and ambient air pollution levels may be an important component of reducing population-level risk of COVID-19 deaths. The results support targeted public health actions to protect residents from COVID-19 in heavily polluted regions with historically high NO2 levels.

The very low prevalence of smokers in our COVID-19 cohort seemingly replicates the findings that can be extracted from descriptive tables in Chinese reports and also in the recent US reports from New York City. 21 patients (5%) were active smokers and 44 (10%) were ex-smokers, while 376 (85%) were non-smokers. The current study is useful since it suggests that smokers may carry some type of protective mechanism from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, although this should definitely be confirmed in specifically-designed, controlled studies. Active smokers were only 21, this number corresponding to less than 5% prevalence of active smokers, which is disproportionately low compared with the 24% prevalence of smokers in the general Italian population (p<0.001).

Unfractionated heparin inhibited spike protein binding with an IC50 value of <0.05U/ml whereas two low molecular weight heparins were much less effective. This suggests that heparin, particularly unfractionated forms, could be considered to reduce clinical manifestations of COVID-19 by inhibiting continuing viral infection. As the spike protein has previously been shown to bind heparin, a soluble glycosaminoglycan, we used a flow cytometry assay to determine the effect of heparin on spike protein binding to RT4 cells.

The results highlight the functionality of individual proteins as well as vulnerability hotspots of SARS-CoV-2, which we targeted with clinically approved drugs. To understand how SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses manipulate the host we here characterized interactome, proteome and signaling processes in a systems- wide manner. Projecting these data onto the global network of cellular interactions revealed relationships between the perturbations taking place upon SARS-CoV-2 infection at different layers and identified unique and common molecular mechanisms of SARS coronaviruses.

show that by introducing age and activity heterogeneities into population models for SARS-CoV-2, herd immunity can be achieved at a population-wide infection rate of 40%, considerably lower than previous estimates. Our simple model shows how the disease-induced herd immunity level may be substantially lower than the classical herd immunity level derived from mathematical models assuming homogeneous immunization.

No clinical data exist to indicate that net benefit is derived from corticosteroids in the treatment of respiratory infection due to RSV, influenza, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV. We conclude that corticosteroid treatment should not be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV-induced lung injury or shock outside of a clinical trial. Corticosteroids have been investigated for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in clinical trials in children, with no conclusive evidence of benefit and are therefore not recommended.

This genomics-informed modeling approach could estimate in near real-time critical surveillance metrics to inform ongoing COVID-19 response efforts. Using a Bayesian inference framework to fit a branching process model to viral phylogeny and time series case data, we estimated time-varying reproductive numbers and their variance, the total numbers of infected individuals, the probability of case detection over time, and the estimated time to detection of an outbreak for 12 locations in Europe, China, and the United States.

Collectively, the results of our study indicate that pre-existing immunity to common coronaviruses does not confer cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. However, their presence did not translate into neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Importantly, we detected serum IgG reactivity to common coronaviruses in the early sera of patients with severe COVID-19 before the appearance of anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

We are delighted to be working with the talented team of investigators in Brazil on the COVID19 vaccine trial, as researchers and scientists around the world collaborate on clinical development work with unprecedented urgency to combat the global threat to human health that is coronavirus. Says Professor Andrew Pollard, Chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial at Oxford University. Brazil is a priority for the study because of the ascendant curve of the COVID-19. On 2 June, the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) approved the inclusion of Brazil in the clinical trials conducted by Oxford University and supported by AstraZeneca, considering 2,000 volunteers to be tested in the country.

Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to generate an in- depth picture of the pulmonary transcriptional landscape of COVID-19 (10 patients), pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza (5) and uninfected control patients (4). Collectively, these data demonstrate that spatial transcriptomics is a powerful tool to identify novel gene signatures within tissues, offering new insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-COV-2 to aid in patient triage and treatment.

While levels of genomic variability between SARS-CoV-2 isolates are limited, to our knowledge, it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super-clades reflect ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, or merely genetic drift and founder effects. Although this study can not be conclusive, we believe that the evidence presented here is strongly consistent with the notion that the biased geographic distribution of SARS- CoV-2 isolates should not be associated with adaptive evolution of this novel pathogen. Here, we analyze more than 1100 complete, high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns/signatures in the genomes of the currently known major clades of SARS-CoV-2. We observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions (including the RDB domain of the spike protein), the more variable genomic regions between extant SARS- CoV-2 episomes correspond with the 3 and 5 UTRs, suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains.

We observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions (including the RDB domain of the spike protein), the more variable genomic regions between extant SARS- CoV-2 episomes correspond with the 3 and 5 UTRs, suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains.
While levels of genomic variability between SARS-CoV-2 isolates are limited, to our knowledge, it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super-clades reflect ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, or merely genetic drift and founder effects.

Saliva viral load correlates with key immunological markers of severity and mortality in Fig. Anti-spike (S) and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG levels were negatively correlated with saliva viral load showing a strong temporal association that could help distinguish severity and mortality in COVID-19. We found that saliva viral load was significantly higher in those with COVID-19 risk factors; that it correlated with increasing levels of disease severity and showed a superior ability over nasopharyngeal viral load as a predictor of mortality over time (AUC=0.90). Saliva viral load correlates with key immunological markers of severity and mortality in COVID-19. Initially, high saliva viral loads and higher loads for longer periods could indicate higher COVID-19 disease severity.

Thus, the results presented in this report explored whether deleterious outcomes from the SARS-COV-2 viral spike protein on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) could be observed. Evidence provided suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins trigger a pro-inflammatory response on brain endothelial cells that may contribute to an altered state of BBB function. Introduction of spike proteins to invitro models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) showed significant changes to barrier properties.
Mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 have a different natural history and trajectory from descriptions of non-COVID ARDS patients, not predictable from admission physiology. Here, we present a data-driven analysis of granular, daily data from a representative proportion of patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within the United Kingdom (UK) to evaluate the complete natural history of COVID-19. Added value of this study This study provides a comprehensive analysis and visualisation of routine clinical measurements tracking the whole ICU time course of patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19.

We find that extrapulmonary manifestations are due to viral metastasis and identify a critical role for type-I but not type-III interferons in preventing systemic viral dissemination. We find that whereas high viral inoculums uniformly led to hypoxemic respiratory failure and death, lethal dose 50% (LD50) inoculums led to a recapitulation of most hallmark clinical features of COVID-19, including lymphocytopenias, heart and liver damage, and autonomic dysfunction.

We developed an immune response phenotyping based on NLR and IgG that could act as a simple complementary tool to discriminate between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 patients and would be helpful in guiding clinical decision. Immune response phenotyping based on late IgG levels and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was characterized to stratify patients with different disease severities and outcome. Methods Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA) in COVID-19 patients from a single center in Wuhan. Interpretation COVID-19 severity is associated with increased IgG response, and an immune response phenotyping based on late IgG response and NLR could act as a simple complementary tool to discriminate between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 patients, and further predict their clinical outcome.

The evaluation published today concludes that the Innova, and other tests which meet PHE and Oxfords standards, should be used in asymptomatic, as they offer the advantage of reducing risk and increasing capacity in addition to Lighthouse and NHS labs. PHE Porton Downs labs have shown four lateral flow tests to have a sensitivity of more than 70% of all PCR positive cases but importantly catch all those with high viral loads, meaning they are effective in identifying the cases who are infectious and are most likely to transmit the disease.

First, Nsp1 acts as a strong inhibitor of translation, tightly binding ribosomes and reducing the pool of available ribosomes that can engage in translation. Following viral infection and translation of viral genomic mRNA (red), Nsp1 acts as a translation inhibitor, reducing the pool of ribosomes that can engage in translation. These findings suggest that the extra density can be assigned to Nsp1 that competes with mRNA for ribosome binding to inhibit translation. 3: SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 inhibits translation in HeLa cell lysates by binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit.

Genetic studies determined that a 25-year-old man from Nevada contracted the coronavirus on two separate occasions. Like the elderly Dutch woman, he experienced a more severe second episode but was able to recover. The woman was not tested for Covid-19 in between her two hospital visits, but Dutch researchers wrote that the two strains differed and that they believed it is likely that the second episode was a reinfection rather than prolonged shedding.

Results: Pollen significantly diminished interferon-λ and pro-inflammatory chemokine responses of airway epithelia to rhinovirus and viral mimics and decreased nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factors. In mice infected with RSV, co- exposure to pollen weakened expression of antiviral genes and increased pulmonary viral titers. Conclusion: The ability of pollen to suppress innate antiviral immunity, independent of allergy, suggests that high-risk population groups should avoid extensive outdoor activities when pollen and respiratory virus seasons coincide.

Surgical mask partition for challenged index or naive hamsters significantly reduced transmission to 25% (6/24, P = .018). Exposure to respiratory droplets can theoretically be reduced by surgical mask usage. Surgical mask partition for challenged index hamsters significantly reduced transmission to only 16.7% (2/12, P = .019) of exposed naive hamsters. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by respiratory droplets or airborne droplet nuclei which could be reduced by surgical mask partition in the hamster model.

We here reveal features of the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which optimize the virus towards different parts of the respiratory tract. Coronavirus spikes exhibit distinct temperature preference to precisely match the upper (~33°C) or lower (37°C) airways. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is related to abundant replication in the upper airways, which is not observed for other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. Collectively, our findings indicate how the coronavirus spike protein is fine- tuned towards the temperature and protease conditions of the airways, to enhance virus transmission and pathology. Even stronger preference for the upper airway temperature of 33°C was evident for the S protein of HCoV-229E, a common cold coronavirus.

Collectively, this report indicates that TfR is another receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and a promising anti-COVID-19 target. TfR-virus co-localization is found both on the membranes and in the cytoplasma, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 transporting by TfR, the iron-transporting receptor shuttling between cell membranes and cytoplasma.

The BMJ The Oxford and AstraZeneca covid-19 vaccine prevented some asymptomatic covid-19 infections in phase III trials, but the effect was mainly seen in the group who received a half dose first, followed by a full dose, the peer reviewed efficacy results have shown.1 The study, published in the Lancet , found that vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic transmission was 59% in the group that received a half dose followed by a standard dose (seven cases among 1120 participants versus 17 cases among 1127 participants in the control group), but just 4% in the group that received two standard doses (22 among 2168 participants versus 23 among 2223 for the control).

Repurposing of Miglustat to inhibit the coronavirus Severe Acquired Respiratory Syndrome S The mechanism resides in the inhibitory activity towards α-glucosidases that are involved in early stages of glycoprotein N-linked oligosaccharide processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a marked decrease of the viral Spike protein. The iminosugar Miglustat is a well-characterized drug for the treatment of rare genetic lysosome storage diseases such as Gaucher and Niemann-Pick type C, and has also been described to be active against a variety of enveloped viruses. The mechanism resides in the inhibitory activity towards -glucosidases that are involved in early stages of glycoprotein N-linked oligosaccharide processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a marked decrease of the viral Spike protein. The activity of Miglustat is here demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations achievable in the plasma by current clinical regimens without cytotoxicity.

Finally, the results demonstrate that the reductions provided by ventilation and masks are synergistic and multiplicative. The use of moderate to high effective filtration efficiency masks by all individuals present, on the other hand, was able to significantly reduce infection probability and could achieve reductions in infection probability by 5x, 10x, or even > 100x dependent on the mask used and use of a mask fitter. The results reinforce the use of properly donned masks to achieve reduced aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases transmitted via respiratory aerosol indoors and provide new motivation to further improve the effective filtration efficiency of common face coverings through improved design, and/or the use of mask fitters. In this paper, we evaluate the efficacy of ventilation, mask effective filtration efficiency, and the combined effect of the two on the reduction of aerosol infection probability for COVID-19 in a classroom setting. However, effective filtration efficiencies approaching the mask material filtration efficiency were achievable using simple mask fitters.

There was one ferret in Group 1 showing detectable, but below the quantifiable limit, viral RNA, and no other INNA-051 treated ferrets showing detectable viral RNA in lung tissue on day 3 and days 12-14 dpc This study provides evidence supporting a novel approach to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, based on reduced viral shedding, following prophylactic i.n administration of INNA-051. We show that prophylactic intra-nasal administration of the TLR2/6 agonist INNA-051 in a SARS-CoV-2 ferret infection model effectively reduces levels of viral RNA in the nose and throat.

Taken together, we observed robust SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated cell-cell fusion that was not dependent on exogenous TMPRSS2 expression and that was not inhibited by Bromhexine. We observed that cell-cell fusion by SARS-CoV-S and SARS-CoV2-S was not inhibited by Bromhexine, and only SARS-CoV-S activity was slightly inhibited by Ambroxol in the presence of TMPRSS2. According to our results the Bromhexine-mediated enhancement was specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and was not seen with VSV-G as fusion effector, nor did we observe significant effects with the SARS-CoV-2-S mutants and SARS-CoV-S (Figs.

Overall, positive baseline anti-spike antibodies were associated with lower rates of PCR-positivity (with or without symptoms) (adjusted rate ratio 0.24 [95%CI 0.08-0.76, p=0.015]). Conclusions Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection that generated antibody responses offered protection from reinfection for most people in the six months following infection.

Cochrane Review: Interventions for the interruption or reduction of the spread of respiratory viruses. We included physical interventions (screening at entry ports, isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection, hand hygiene) to prevent respiratory virus transmission. The highest quality cluster-RCTs suggest respiratory virus spread can be prevented by hygienic measures, such as handwashing, especially around younger children. Interventions for the interruption or reduction of the spread of respiratory viruses.

Coronavirus patients recover faster if they undergo rehabilitation as soon as possible after coming off ventilators or leaving intensive care COVID-19 patients can suffer long-term lung and heart damage but, for many, this tends to improve over time, according to the first, prospective follow-up of patients infected with the coronavirus, presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress. And nearly six in ten patients had heart problems after six weeks, although this may be only indirectly linked to COVID-19, a sign of the severity of the disease in general. COVID-19 patients can suffer long-term lung and heart damage but, for many, this tends to improve over time, according to Austrian scientists. Dr Sahanic's presentation is important because it is one of the first, comprehensive prospective follow-ups of these patients and shows the serious, long-term impact of COVID-19 on the lungs and heart. The bad news is that people show lung impairment from COVID-19 weeks after discharge; the good news is that the impairment tends to ameliorate over time, which suggests the lungs have a mechanism for repairing themselves, said Dr Sabina Sahanic, who is a clinical PhD student at the University Clinic in Innsbruck and part of the team that carried out the study, which includes Associate Professor Ivan Tancevski, Professor Judith Löffler-Ragg and Dr Thomas Sonnweber in Innsbruck.

Our study reveals notable correlations between COVID-19 severity and both viral exposure history and overall strength of the antibody response to past infections. We mapped the landscape of linear epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, characterized their specificity or cross- reactivity, and investigated serological and viral exposure history correlates of COVID-19 severity.

Dexamethasone was first considered a potential treatment for COVID-19 because of its ability to reduce inflammation, which plays an important role in the disease process in some patients who have been admitted to hospital with COVID-19. In patients receiving oxygen without mechanical ventilation, the figures were 23% with dexamethasone and 26% with usual care, with a relative reduction of about 20%. Dexamethasone can be taken by mouth or given as an injection or infusion (drip) into a vein. Based on the review of available data, EMA is endorsing the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents (from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg) who require supplemental oxygen therapy. The CHMPs scientific opinion can be taken into account by EU member states and EMA when evaluating dexamethasone medicines for the treatment of COVID-19.

Using a previously reported COVID-19 prediction model, we show that it is possible to conduct a GWAS on predicted COVID-19 which benefits from a larger sample size in order to gain new insights into the genetic susceptibility of the disease. Recently, it was shown that it is possible to predict potential COVID-19 cases using cross- sectional self-reported disease-related symptoms. Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence that genetic variants for other viral infectious diseases do not overlap with COVID-19 susceptibility and that severity of COVID-19 may have a different genetic architecture compared to COVID-19 susceptibility.

Thus, both the furin score and molecular docking revealed that the insertion sequence of SARS-CoV-2 facilitates the TMPRSS2 recognition and S protein cleavage. The two potential Spike protein cleavage sites of SARS-CoV and SARS- CoV-2 by TMPRSS2. We speculated that R682, R683 and R685 (red box) could be used as the most suitable substrates for TMPRSSs, which can increase the Spike protein cleavage efficiency of TMPRSSs, promote its activation and enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In Pfizers trial, all four participants who experienced Bells palsy received the vaccine. These are 3 of the 4 volunteers who developed Bells palsy after being vaccinated with the Pfizer (SIC) covid experimental vaccine. As the United Kingdom began administering people with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, four people who got Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine in the firm's trial developed Bell's palsy, a form of temporary facial paralysis, according to US regulators' report on the shot. Ill go on to say there were deaths in the trial and none of them were linked to the vaccine. To be clear, four participants in the Pfizer vaccine trial and four participants in Modernas trial did experience Bells palsy.
