3	Our companion diagnostics showed that after three days of therapy, the immune profile in these patients approached normal levels and the levels of cytokines involved in the cytokine storm were much improved. Jacob Lalezari, M.D., Interim Chief Medical Officer of CytoDyn, commented, These preliminary results give hope that leronlimab may help hospitalized patients with COVID-19 recover from the pulmonary inflammation that drives mortality and the need for ventilators. The treatment with leronlimab is targeted as a therapy for patients who experience respiratory complications as a result of contracting SARS-CoV-2 causing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Moreover, a Phase 2b clinical trial demonstrated that leronlimab monotherapy can prevent viral escape in HIV-infected patients; some patients on leronlimab monotherapy have remained virally suppressed for more than five years. Clinical results to date from multiple trials have shown that leronlimab can significantly reduce viral burden in people infected with HIV with no reported drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs).

35	Using lentiviral pseudotypes and a cell- culture adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus with a S1/S2 deletion, we show that the polybasic insertion is selected for in lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures but selected against in Vero E6, a cell line used for passaging SARS-CoV-2. The furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a key determinant for transmission We find this selective advantage depends on expression of the cell surface protease, TMPRSS2, that allows virus entry independent of endosomes thus avoiding antiviral IFITM proteins. SARS-CoV-2 has a unique polybasic insertion at the S1/S2 CS, which we demonstrate can be cleaved by furin.

Fortunately, other attributes of saliva-based antigen testing make this feasible: unlike PCR, it doesnt require trained personnel, specific chemical supplies, or centralized, expensive laboratory instrument; it is less vulnerable to the supply chain bottlenecks that plague PCR-based labs; it returns results in a matter of hours; it costs as little as $1 per test; and it could be as convenient as sucking on a piece of paper.

127	In the aggregate, the analysis confirms and extends our previous preliminary finding that transfusion of COVID-19 patients soon after hospitalization with high titer anti-spike protein RBD IgG present in convalescent plasma significantly reduces mortality. Transfusion of convalescent plasma collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 disease has emerged as a promising therapy and has been granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). With respect to altering mortality, our analysis identified an optimal window of 44 hours post-hospitalization for transfusing COVID-19 patients with high titer convalescent plasma.

174	Clearly we need more information about these patients, such as were there underlying medical conditions or a change in circumstances that might have allowed the virus to escape immune control? However, the report reinforces the fact that we have to investigate all such findings really thoroughly and report such information if we are to make the best decisions based on sound scientific evidence. She has a prolonged excretion of virus from her initial infection and tests were either not done or were not done sufficiently well or enough to confirm clearance. Although coronaviruses generally cause short- term self-limiting infections which are cleared, there is some evidence in the scientific literature for persistent infections of animal coronaviruses (mainly in bats). This highlights the need for more research into the biology of the new coronavirus, it is very much early days in our efforts to understand it.

Our results indicated that oral mucosa tissues are susceptible to 2019-nCov, which provides valuable information for virus-prevention strategy in clinical care as well as daily life. Results The bioinformatics results indicated the differential expression of ACE2 and FURIN on epithelial cells of different oral mucosal tissues and the proportion of FURIN-positive cells was obviously higher than that of ACE2-positive cells. The S-glycoprotein, which recognized as the key factor for the entry of 2019-nCov into the cell, contains two functional domains: an ACE2 receptor binding domain and a second domain necessary for fusion of the coronavirus and cell membranes.

299	Our study serves as a publicly available single-cell atlas of SARS-CoV-2 related entry factors and interaction partners in human and mouse brain endothelial- and perivascular cells, which can be employed for future studies in clinical samples of COVID-19 patients. We observed a distinct expression pattern of the cathepsins B (CTSB) and -L (CTSL) - which are able to substitute for the ACE2 co-receptor TMPRSS2 - in the human vasculature with CTSB being mainly expressed in the brain vasculature and CTSL predominantly in the peripheral vasculature, and these observations were confirmed at the protein level in the Human Protein Atlas and using immunofluorescence stainings. This expression pattern of SARS-CoV-2 viral-entry associated proteases and SARS-CoV-2 interaction partners was also present in endothelial cells and microglia in the fetal brain, suggesting a developmentally established SARS-CoV-2 entry machinery in the human vasculature. At both the adult and fetal stages, we detected a distinct pattern of SARS-CoV-2 entry associated genes transcripts in brain vascular endothelial cells and microglia, providing a potential explanation for an inflammatory response in the brain endothelium upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

343	In summary, lack of immune homology between SARS-CoV-2 and VPD pathogens suggests that childhood immunization history (i.e., BCG vaccination or others) does not provide protection from SARS-CoV-2 through adaptive cross-immunity. Little to no immune homology between SARS-CoV-2 and VPD pathogens: insignificant aligned protein sequences, unmapped immune epitopes, or matched N-glycosylation sites with different glycosylation potentials and positions.

363	Researchers estimated a risk for COVID-19 diagnosis of 30.0 per 10.000 and 3.7 per 10,000 for death among HIV-positive people receiving ART. Risk of COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization was lower for people living with HIV receiving Truvada, or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC), compared with those on other ART regimens, as well as the Spanish population ages 20-79, reported Julia del Amo, MD, PhD, of the National Plan Against AIDS in Madrid, and colleagues. Moreover, the risk of COVID-19 diagnosis was not higher among people living with HIV on ART than the general population of Spain, they wrote in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The lack of increased risk for serious COVID-19 among HIV-positive persons might be the result of their use of ART, they wrote, adding ART was proposed as a protective factor against SARS in 2003, but there were too few cases to draw meaningful conclusions about its role.

529	Results Compared to healthy controls, the overall ACE2 (receptor of SARS- CoV-2) expression was significantly higher in lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients, in particular in ciliated cell, club cell and basal cell. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the community interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells: the interaction between epithelial cells with macrophage, T and NK cell was stronger, but their interaction with neutrophils was lost in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection activates pro-inflammatory signaling in lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and causes dysregulation of immune response to release more pro-inflammatory cytokines.

624	To explore the direct involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS in physiologically relevant models, the research team assessed SARS-CoV-2 infection in human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), neurospheres and brain organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Overall, our study provides the first evidence of direct SARS-CoV-2 infection in human brain organoids, which contributes to our understanding of the pathogenesis of neurological complications in COVID-19, said Prof. HUANG Jiandong from HKU, who led the study. Extensive protein expression and infectious viral particles were detected in neurospheres and brain organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2, which suggested SARS-CoV-2 could productively infect the human brain. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection in 3D human brain organoids was localised to TUJ1 (neuronal marker) - and NESTIN (NPC marker)-positive cells, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 could directly target cortical neurons and NPCs.

In conclusion, our study identified a new mechanism by which PLpro of betacoronaviruses induces viral pathogenesis by targeting cellular autophagic pathway (Word count=250) IMPORTANCE The recent COVID-19 global pandemic alongside the 2003 SARS and 2012 MERS outbreaks underscore an urgent need to better understand betacoronaviruses as pathogens that pose global challenge to human health. To investigate whether virus-encoded proteases target this protein, we conducted in vitro and cellular cleavage assays and identified ULK1 as a novel bona fide substrate of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). Using murine hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59) as a model betacoronavirus , time-course infections revealed a significant loss in the protein level of ULK1, a canonical autophagy regulating serine-threonine kinase, and the concomitant appearance of a possible cleavage fragment. Consistent with this, over-expression of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is sufficient to impair starvation-induced canonical autophagy and disrupt formation of ULK1-ATG13 complex.

714	These data highlight the value of Organ Chip technology as a more stringent and physiologically relevant platform for drug repurposing, and suggest that amodiaquine should be considered for future clinical testing. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Airway Chips were used to assess the inhibitory activities of approved drugs that showed inhibition in traditional cell culture assays only to find that most failed when tested in the Organ Chip platform. We provide a first demonstration of drug repurposing by using oseltamivir in influenza A virus-infected organ chip cultures and show that co-administration of the approved anticoagulant drug, nafamostat, can double oseltamivirs therapeutic time window. Here we show that human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture devices lined by highly differentiated human primary lung airway epithelium and endothelium can be used to model virus entry, replication, strain- dependent virulence, host cytokine production, and recruitment of circulating immune cells in response to infection by respiratory viruses with great pandemic potential.

825	Findings, published in JAMA Pediatrics, point to the possibility that the youngest children transmit the virus as much as other age groups. Our study was not designed to prove that younger children spread COVID-19 as much as adults, but it is a possibility, says Dr. Heald-Sargent. The ability of younger children to spread COVID-19 may have been under-recognized given the rapid and sustained closure of schools and daycare during the pandemic. We found that children under 5 with COVID-19 have a higher viral load than older children and adults, which may suggest greater transmission, as we see with respiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV, says lead author Taylor Heald-Sargent, MD, PhD, pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Lurie Children's and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

We investigated the breadth and potency of antibody-, and T-cell immune responses, in 203 recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who presented with asymptomatic to severe infections. These data support the possibility of achieving protective immunity through natural infection and bode well for the prospects of inducing immunological memory through vaccination. To understand the immunological signature of SARS-CoV-2 infections and aid the search for treatments and vaccines, comprehensive characterization of adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed.

Keywords: COVID-19; conspiracy theories; longitudinal; social distancing. Conclusions: Our findings show that COVID-19 conspiracy theories pose a significant threat to public health as they may reduce adherence to social distancing measures. Results: Multivariate growth curve analyses showed that, although conspiracy beliefs decreased and social distancing increased over time, people holding more conspiracy beliefs at the beginning of the pandemic showed the lowest increase in social distancing. Moreover, cross-lagged analyses demonstrated that people who reported more conspiracy beliefs at any wave tended to report less social distancing at the following wave.

899	We show that SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterised by extensive within-host diversity, which is frequently shared among infected individuals with patterns consistent with geographical structure. Rapid sequencing and publication of consensus genomes have enabled phylogenetic analysis of the virus, demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 evolves relatively slowly1, but with multiple sites in the genome that appear inconsistent with the overall consensus phylogeny2. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 diversity is transmissible, and propose that geographic patterns are generated by co- circulation of distinct viral populations.

The first evidence that common steroids could improve the survival of patients with severe Covid-19 came in June when British researchers conducting a large clinical trial called RECOVERY reported that the use of dexamethasone reduced the death rate by 35% in patients requiring ventilation and by 20% in patients who needed oxygen but were not ventilated. But it cautioned against use of the steroids in patients with non-severe illness, saying that indiscriminate use of any therapy for COVID-19 would potentially rapidly deplete global resources and deprive patients who may benefit from it most as potentially life-saving therapy. advertisement The consistent findings of benefit in these studies provide definitive data that corticosteroids should be first-line treatment for critically ill patients with COVID-19, said Hallie Prescott and Todd Rice, professors of medicine at the University of Michigan and Vanderbilt University, respectively, in an accompanying JAMA editorial.

951	Using the Syrian hamster model of self-limited moderate COVID-19, we defined the specific roles of endothelial and epithelial cells, among other myeloid and non-myeloid lung cell subtypes, for determining the disease course. In depth vascular and pulmonary compartment analyses (i) supported the hypothesis that monocyte-derived macrophages dominate inflammation, (ii) revealed endothelial inflammation status and T-cell attraction, and (iii) showed that CD4+ and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell responses precede viral elimination. Comparison of hamster single-cell sequencing and proteomics with data sets from COVID-19 patients demonstrated inter- species concordance of cellular and molecular host-pathogen interactions.

Bats have evolved novel mechanisms to limit virus-induced pro-inflammatory responses while maintaining type I IFN responses to limit virus propagation (Figure 1). Bats Suppress the Pathological Effects of Excessive Virus-Induced Inflammation While bats are well prepared to control viral infections, they also have mechanisms to avoid over-induction of inflammatory genes. This suggests that many bats have a mechanism to suppress the expression of TNFα, thereby maintaining a balanced response to viral infection.

The majority is clearly European, said Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who co-wrote a study awaiting peer review. Officially, the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in New York City on February 29, but a new report based on genomic analysis suggests the disease was introduced as early as January, and that most cases were linked to Europe, rather than Asia. Of the remaining isolates, the vast majority (87%) clustered with clade A2a, and the majority of isolates in that clade (72%) are cases of patients with COVID-19 in Europe, suggesting that Europe was the major origin of COVID-19 cases in New York in march, the authors write.

Infection fatality rates (IFR) estimates are higher in our analysis (>2%) than previously reported values, likely resulting from the epidemics in these three states affecting the most vulnerable sub-populations, especially the most vulnerable of the 80 age group. A second key question to follow during this time was whether clinical characteristics of the epidemic would improve after the initial surge of cases.

We've shown that the prevalence of infection has remained high, reinforcing the need for people to act to help bring infections down and control the virus. But in the latest results these trends are reduced, suggesting that the epidemic has progressed from clustering in certain at-risk groups to generalised spread in the community.

1416	Now, researchers at Duke University have identified a number of silent mutations in the roughly 30,000 letters of the virus's genetic code that helped it thrive once it made the leap -- and possibly helped set the stage for the global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, appears to have evolved silent changes to its RNA code that gave it a biological edge over previous strains. The researchers report that so-called silent mutations in two other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, dubbed Nsp4 and Nsp16, appear to have given the virus a biological edge over previous strains without altering the proteins they encode.

SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, appears to have evolved silent changes to its RNA code that gave it a biological edge over previous strains. The researchers report that so-called silent mutations in two other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, dubbed Nsp4 and Nsp16, appear to have given the virus a biological edge over previous strains without altering the proteins they encode.

1423	This randomized trial did not demonstrate a significant benefit of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for COVID-19, the authors of the study, a team of US and Canadian researchers, wrote in the paper. Analysis of the two treatment groups showed that the difference in the incidence of new illness compatible with COVID-19 was not statistically significant11.8% of those receiving hydroxychloroquine (49 of 414) got sick, compared with 14.3% of those receiving placebo (58 of 407). In the current trial, the long delay between perceived exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the initiation of hydroxychloroquine ( 3 days in most participants) suggests what was being assessed was prevention of symptoms or progression of COVID-19, rather than prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, Myron Cohen, MD, of the Institute for Global and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, wrote.

1504	It supports an earlier study published in April that evaluated MK-7 in 123 patients with COVID-19 and 184 controls, revealing a link between vitamin K2 deficiency and disease severity. The researchers write: Therefore, MK-7 deficiency can be a risk factor for increasing the severity of the COVID-19 disease and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with comorbid conditions tend to develop acute manifestations. This paper strengthens the concept that vitamin K2 as MK-7 is a nutrient with substantial ability to protect pulmonary function during an active virus. According to the authors, a profound increase in inactive matrix Gla protein (MGP) levels were observed in COVID-19 patients, indicating a poor K2 status and associated increased risk of mortality from comorbidities (such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases).

1701	However, whether the increasing prevalence of the S-614G variant represents a fitness advantage that improves replication and/or transmission in humans or is merely due to founder effects remains elusive. Here, we generated isogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants and demonstrate that the S-614G variant has (i) enhanced binding to human ACE2, (ii) increased replication in primary human bronchial and nasal airway epithelial cultures as well as in a novel human ACE2 knock-in mouse model, and (iii) markedly increased replication and transmissibility in hamster and ferret models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our data show that while the S-614G substitution results in subtle increases in binding and replication in vitro , it provides a real competitive advantage in vivo , particularly during the transmission bottle neck, providing an explanation for the global predominance of S-614G variant among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently circulating.

1794	This point has to do with the evolution of the virus in the human host. Later on, the spread of the infection reduces the pool of susceptible hosts and may reverse the selection on virulence. Infectious sources are susceptible to evolution, and selective pressure by host characteristics and measure to control the pandemic may lead to emergence of more aggressive or indolent strains. More specifically, we expect drastic changes of virulence between early and later stages of global pandemics, but also between different stages of the pathogen life cycle.

However some scientists believe two doses may be needed to immunise the population, meaning around 500,000 sharks would need to be slaughtered, according to the California-based group's calculations.	500,000 sharks cannot be killed to vaccinate against covid-19, wildlife experts say	not_entailment

1879	Conclusions To the best of our knowledge this is the first study evaluating disease outcomes in a large set of laboratory-positive cases of symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection and factors associated with illness severity was characterized. Our results may contribute to the current knowledge of SARS-COV-2 pathogenicity and to identify populations at increased risk of a poorer outcome after reinfection. We used risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate predictors of severe (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) secondary SARS-COV-2 infection. In multiple analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of severe symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection were increasing age (RR per year = 1.007, 95% CI 1.003-1.010), comorbidities (namely obesity [RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.24], asthma [RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.50], type 2 diabetes mellitus [RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.38] and previous severe laboratory- confirmed COVID-19 (RR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.39).

1894	Here, in 10 terminally-ill, critical COVID-19 patients we report profound elevation of plasma IL-6 and CCL5 (RANTES), decreased CD8+ T cell levels, and SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia.

These results demonstrate a novel approach to resolving unchecked inflammation, restoring immunologic deficiencies, and reducing SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load via disruption of the CCL5-CCR5 axis, and support randomized clinical trials to assess clinical efficacy of leronlimab-mediated inhibition of CCR5 for COVID-19.

1932	The prospective goal of generating this very large collection was to select pairs of highly potent individual antibodies that could simultaneously bind the RBD spike, and thus might be ideal partners for a therapeutic antibody cocktail that not only could be an effective treatment, but might also protect against antibody resistance resulting from virus escape mutants that could arise in response to selective pressure from single-antibody treatments. Our data strongly support the notion that cocktail therapy may provide a powerful way to minimize mutational escape by SARS-CoV-2; in particular, our studies point to the potential value of antibody cocktails in which two antibodies were chosen so as to bind to distinct and non-overlapping regions of the viral target (in this case, the RBD of the spike protein), and thus require the unlikely occurrence of simultaneous mutations at two distinct genetic sites for viral escape. To functionally confirm that the spike protein mutations detected by sequencing are responsible for the loss of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by the antibodies, we generated VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoparticles expressing the individual identified spike mutations. For an antibody cocktail in which the components demonstrate complete competition (REGN10989+REGN10934), a single amino acid substitution was sufficient to ablate neutralization of the cocktail; hence, both of these antibodies require binding to the Glu484 residue in order to neutralize SARS-CoV-2.

1956	In agreement with our findings, a recent report shows inactivation of SARS- CoV-2 in N95 respirators after 60 minutes exposure to 70°C dry heat.23 Others have shown that shorter thermal disinfection protocols (15 to 40 min at 75°C to 100°C and 0% to 100% relative humidity) maintain the fit and filtration of N95 respirators after multiple disinfection cycles, but without testing the viricidal effects of those protocols.2629 Beyond thermal disinfection, alternative decontamination procedures have been studied, including ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation (250280 nm), autoclaving or chemical treatments using 70% ethanol or 2% chlorine solutions (some references from nonpeer-reviewed preprint).23,2835 Autoclaving and chemical treatments have been shown to rapidly degrade filtration efficiency of N95 respirators and are therefore ineligible for clinical use.23,28,3436 In contrast, UV light decontamination systems may represent a promising approach as they seem to maintain respirator function and inactivate SARS- CoV-2.23,33 However, the scalability of UV decontamination may be limited, as stacking of the masks and consequent shadowing may further impair the limited penetration depth of UV light in porous N95 filter material.28 In conjunction with alternative reprocessing strategies, thermal disinfection can be used as a rapidly applicable emergency measure to alleviate the present global shortage of N95 respirators. INTERPRETATION: Thermal disinfection successfully decontaminated N95 respirators without impairing structural integrity or function. Results A single heat treatment inactivated both SARS-CoV-2 (undetectable, detection limit: 100 TCID50/ml) and E. coli (0 colonies at 50%RH) in all four respirator models.

2015	Since the novel coronavirus was first discovered in China, it has undergone many mutations but WHO experts say such changes are to be expected and that they have not been so extreme as to make vaccines being developed against it ineffective. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth via CN) (CN)  A potentially dangerous mutation of the novel coronavirus found to be spreading rapidly in the United Kingdom is causing alarm across Europe and prompting countries to close off travel with Britain. Drosten notes that the new mutant also carries a deletion in another viral gene, ORF8, that previous studies suggest might reduce the virus ability to spread. On Saturday, the U.K. imposed strict lockdown measures to stop the spread of a new variant of the virus that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said is much more transmissible, though he said there was no evidence it was more lethal or more resistant to vaccines.

2237	Another previous report by Callow (4) suggested that HCoV-229E-specific antibodies in serum and nasal wash specimens were correlated with protection from experimental infection with HCoV-229E and disease, and IgA antibodies to HCoV-229E in nasal wash specimens were associated with a reduced duration of viral shedding in nasal secretions. Based on the much lower frequency of patients with HCoV-specific IgA antibody in nasal wash specimens than of those with IgG in serum in our older adult population, one might hypothesize that antibodies to HCoV in nasal secretions decline in titer more rapidly after infection than do serum antibodies or that infection does not induce IgA antibody to HCoV in nasal secretions to high titers or at all in a significant proportion of older, chronically ill patients with COPD. Hence, despite the near-universal presence of serum antibodies to the HCoV strains in our study, the lower rates of detectable IgA antibodies to HCoV suggest a possible reason for susceptibility to reinfections with HCoV, if IgA antibodies in nasal secretions are indeed protective.

2272	Conclusions The detection and serial monitoring of this subset of inflammatory monocytes using flow cytometry could be of great help in guiding the prognostication and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and merits further evaluation. Findings While we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals,we did identify significant morphological and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization and ICU admission. Patients with COVID-19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter, side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry,with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high forward scatter (FSC- high). Methods We performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome.

Patients with COVID-19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter, side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry,with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high forward scatter (FSC- high). Methods We performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome.

2292	Recently, a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage called B.1.1.7 has emerged in the United Kingdom that was reported to spread more efficiently than other strains. While the pseudovirus system used is a surrogate for authentic SARS-CoV-2, previous studies have shown excellent concordance between pseudotype neutralization and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays.i The preserved neutralization of the pseudovirus bearing the U.K. strain spike by BNT162b2- immune sera makes it likely that COVID-19 caused by the U.K. virus variant will also be prevented by immunization with BNT162b2. Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses bearing either the Wuhan reference strain or the B.1.1.7 lineage spike protein with sera of 16 participants in a previously reported trial with the mRNA- based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2.

Besides, the analysis of the average air temperatures shows that the epidemic rates of COVID-19 were higher in the case studies with a lower average temperature. Conversely, if there are no significant differences in the mean daily temperature of two regions in the same country, no significant difference is observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases for these regions.

Infection fatality rate was estimated from each study dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths at a relevant time point by the number of estimated people infected in each relevant region. Estimates of infection fatality rates inferred from seroprevalence studies tend to be much lower than original speculations made in the early days of the pandemic.

An arms race with an ancient corona-like virus may thus have taken place in ancestral East Asian populations. Here, we apply evolutionary analyses to human genomic datasets to recover selection events involving tens of human genes that interact with coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, that started 25,000 years ago. Notably, modern human genomes contain evolutionary information tracing back tens of thousands of years, which may help identify the viruses that have impacted our ancestors  pointing to which viruses have future pandemic potential.

2359	Here we show that CRISPR- Cas9 knockout of furin reduces, but does not prevent, the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. Comparing S processing in furin knockout cells to multibasic site mutants reveals that while loss of furin substantially reduces S1-S2 cleavage it does not prevent it. Our results show that while furin promotes both SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and cell-cell spread it is not essential, suggesting furin inhibitors will not prevent viral spread. We show that loss of furin in either donor or acceptor cells reduces, but does not prevent, TMPRSS2-dependent cell-cell fusion, unlike mutation of the multibasic site that completely prevents syncytia formation.

2390	We report an important transition across the levels of social distancing compliance, in the range between 70% and 80% levels. Strong compliance with social distancing (at 80% and above) effectively controls the disease during the suppression period, while lower levels of compliance (at 70% or less) do not succeed for any duration of the suppression. This suggests that a compliance of below 70% is unlikely to succeed for any duration of social distancing, while a compliance at the 90% level is likely to control the disease within 13-14 weeks, when coupled with effective case isolation and international travel restrictions. The research found that if 90 percent of the Australian population adopted social distancing, the spread of COVID-19 could be controlled by July 2020, whereas social distancing of less than 70 percent would not suppress the pandemic. by Mihai Andrei April 7, 2020 in Health & Medicine, News, Research, Science Strong social distancing measures can curb the pandemic in 13 weeks or so -- but only if 80% of the people do it, a new study claims.

2433	We are in agreement with the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, which states that if the government wished to move away from the WHO regulation and its own previous regulation, which permitted both cremation and burial, the government should have consulted leaders of the Muslim community including medical professionals and scientists of the faith, said the NPC. Ahmed Shaheed, UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief, has urged the Sri Lankan government to respect Islamic burial rights and stop hate speech against Muslims. Lakmal said there is no scientific evidence to support the conclusion that cremation is safer than burial to avoid infection from COVID-19.

2495	They found that death rates dropped for all groups, even older patients by 18 percentage points on average. The BBC previously reported this fall in the death rate among patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus, when University of Oxford researchers estimated it had fallen from 6% to 1.5% between the peak in April and June. University of Oxford researchers found the proportion of coronavirus patients dying each day in England fell from 6% to 1.5% between April and June. The proportion of patients admitted to critical care who die fell by almost a quarter from the peak and as much as half in hospitals overall. Based on a much smaller number of patients admitted between the 1 September and the start of October, the death rate now appears to be about a quarter of that level.

Their newborns are at a higher risk of prematurity and early separation from their mothers, who may subsequently require intensive care for their own health.1,2 Although neonates born of mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy are seemingly vulnerable to infection, studies have found that they were not at a high risk for severe infection and were very rarely affected by COVID-19.1,2,3,4,5,6 The presence of virus by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been reported in newborns before H 12 of life.1 In addition, antiviral immunoglobulin M has been detected in newborns at birth,7 suggesting that mother-to-infant viral transmission may occur.8 To date, however, only one case of vertical transmission has been clearly demonstrated.9 In several cases of early neonatal infection, postnatal contamination cannot be excluded.10 Moreover, only one case report found that the virus could pass from mother to infant through the mothers breast milk.11 Despite these findings, international or national guidelines on the management of newborns of mothers suspected or positive for COVID-19, including Chinese consensus guidelines and guidelines of the American Academic of Pediatrics, have recommended at least temporary separation of mother and newborn as a precaution.12,13 In contrast, other guidelines,14 including those of the French Society of Neonatology,15,16 do not recommend systematic separation.

2568	Figure 1 available in the PDF version Enhanced hygiene and social distancing measures may reduce both numbers of cases and severity of cases through several mechanisms We suggest that a pre-emptive implementation of low cost interventions prior to detection, but in imminent expectation of community transmission should be considered because it may decrease both the total numbers of cases and severity of cases. Pre-emptive, low cost, hygiene enhancement and social distancing in the context of imminent community transmission of novel coronavirus COVID-19 should be considered. These low cost enhanced hygiene and physical distancing measures are applicable preemptively before confirmation of local community transmission or where transmission of SARSCoV2 appears to be under control. Hygiene measures mostly act on the second factor, as they reduce the risk of transmission if a contact occurs. Here we explore whether low cost pre-emptive enhanced hygiene and social distancing should be implemented prior to confirmation of community transmission in countries without, or with minimal, confirmed person-to-person transmission of COVID-19.

2829	Stronger responses could be elicited consistently from existing vaccines by simply using sleep to make them more effective. This research could pave the way for new vaccination strategies, in which patients are immunized at particular times of day, and when they can be sure of getting a good nights sleep. Sleep enhances the human antibody response to hepatitis A vaccination. The sleep-induced promotion of Th cell proliferation and the shift of the Th1/Th2 balance towards Th1 cytokines during early SWS-rich sleep likely represent further components of the immuno-enhancing influence of sleep after vaccination. Thus, sleep after vaccination can enhance the subsequent adaptive immune response like an adjuvant (see below).	Sleep after vaccination boosts immunological memory.	entailment

Active smokers were only 21, this number corresponding to less than 5% prevalence of active smokers, which is disproportionately low compared with the 24% prevalence of smokers in the general Italian population (p<0.001).

3053	While levels of genomic variability between SARS-CoV-2 isolates are limited, to our knowledge, it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super-clades reflect ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, or merely genetic drift and founder effects. Although this study can not be conclusive, we believe that the evidence presented here is strongly consistent with the notion that the biased geographic distribution of SARS- CoV-2 isolates should not be associated with adaptive evolution of this novel pathogen. Here, we analyze more than 1100 complete, high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns/signatures in the genomes of the currently known major clades of SARS-CoV-2. We observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions (including the RDB domain of the spike protein), the more variable genomic regions between extant SARS- CoV-2 episomes correspond with the 3 and 5 UTRs, suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains.

3152	We here reveal features of the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which optimize the virus towards different parts of the respiratory tract. Coronavirus spikes exhibit distinct temperature preference to precisely match the upper (~33°C) or lower (37°C) airways. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is related to abundant replication in the upper airways, which is not observed for other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. Collectively, our findings indicate how the coronavirus spike protein is fine- tuned towards the temperature and protease conditions of the airways, to enhance virus transmission and pathology. Even stronger preference for the upper airway temperature of 33°C was evident for the S protein of HCoV-229E, a common cold coronavirus.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is related to abundant replication in the upper airways, which is not observed for other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. Collectively, our findings indicate how the coronavirus spike protein is fine- tuned towards the temperature and protease conditions of the airways, to enhance virus transmission and pathology. Even stronger preference for the upper airway temperature of 33°C was evident for the S protein of HCoV-229E, a common cold coronavirus.

According to our results the Bromhexine-mediated enhancement was specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and was not seen with VSV-G as fusion effector, nor did we observe significant effects with the SARS-CoV-2-S mutants and SARS-CoV-S (Figs.
