19	The study provides preventive measures related to air pollution to limit future outbreaks of morbidity and mortality due to the coronavirus. Epidemiologists widely agree that there is a correlation between acute and locally elevated concentrations of fine particles and the severity of influenza waves. The increase in fine particles is generally favored by air temperature inversions, characterized by fog situations, or by Saharan dust intrusions. A multifactorial pandemic Nonetheless, the researchers also emphasize that, although particulate matter pollution can influence the virulence of the virus and possible severe disease progression, physiological, social or economic factors will clearly also influence the further course of the pandemic.

29	Overall, our study highlights GNS561 as a powerful drug in SARS- CoV-2 infection and supports that the hypothesis that autophagy inhibitors could be an alternative strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data indicated that GNS561 showed the highest antiviral effect for two SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to CQ and remdesivir. Finally, our study revealed that the combination of GNS561 and remdesivir was associated with a strong synergistic antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity and associated mechanism of GNS561, a small basic lipophilic molecule inhibitor of late-stage autophagy, against SARS-CoV-2.

31	Severe allergy-like reactions in at least eight people who received the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech over the past 2 weeks may be due to a compound in the packaging of the messenger RNA (mRNA) that forms the vaccines main ingredient, scientists say. Patients with severe allergies in the US are getting nervous about the possibility that they may not be able to get vaccinated, at least with those two vaccines, Togias wrote in an invitation to meeting participants. Some allergists and immunologists believe a small number of people previously exposed to PEG may have high levels of antibodies against PEG, putting them at risk of an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine. NIAID is also setting up a study in collaboration with FDA to analyze the response to the vaccine in people who have high levels of anti-PEG antibodies or have experienced severe allergic responses to drugs or vaccines before.	Suspicions grow that nanoparticles in Pfizer 's COVID-19 vaccine trigger rare allergic reactions.

48	Photo: Ulf Sirborn Our results indicate that public immunity to COVID-19 is probably significantly higher than antibody tests have suggested, says Professor Hans- Gustaf Ljunggren at the Center for Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, and co-senior author. One interesting observation was that it wasnt just individuals with verified COVID-19 who showed T-cell immunity but also many of their exposed asymptomatic family members, says Soo Aleman. Our results indicate that roughly twice as many people have developed T-cell immunity compared with those who we can detect antibodies in. In the present study, the researchers performed immunological analyses of samples from over 200 people, many of whom had mild or no symptoms of COVID-19.	Immunity to COVID-19 is probably higher than tests have shown

52	To replace microscopic counting-based SARS-CoV-2 PRNTs by a novel assay exempt from genetically modified viruses, which are inapplicable in most diagnostics departments, we established a simple, rapid, and automated SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay employing an in- cell ELISA (icELISA) approach. A novel in-cell ELISA assay allows rapid and automated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 to analyse neutralizing antibodies and antiviral compounds. Altogether, the SARS-CoV-2 icELISA test allows rapid (<48 h in total, read-out in seconds) and automated quantification of virus infection in cell culture to evaluate the efficacy of NAbs and antiviral drugs using reagents and equipment present in most routine diagnostics departments.

56	The use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission. One of the most well-known attempts to justify sending workers back to offices and factories based on a supposed antibody count comes from the controversial Santa Clara study, as it has come to be known. The Stanford researchers acknowledged as much in the study and used test performance weights to scale results, but Rutherford was skeptical of these weights, as well as the population weights the researchers used. In a peer review of the antibody study published to Medium, former Stanford lecturer Balaji Srinivasan, who specializes in statistics and computational biology, argued the selection methods could have overstated the prevalence of the disease in the county. Dr. Natalie E. Dean, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, tweeted that she had concerns with the adjustments made for clustering (some participants brought children and other household members with them to the test) and test characteristics (researchers assume no false positives but some false negatives).	Stanford professor Balaji S. Srinivasan 's peer review of the Santa Clara seroprevalence study indicates that its high reported positive rate results may be explained by the false positive rate of the test and/or by sample recruitment issues .

75	Within this library, ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed human coronavirus replication in cultured cells, but did not suppress replication of respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus. After the eleventh consecutive MERS-CoV passage in the presence of ciclesonide, a resistant mutation was generated, which resulted in an amino acid substitution (A25V) in nonstructural protein (NSP) 15, as identified using reverse genetics. These observations suggest that the effect of ciclesonide was specific to coronavirus, suggesting this is a candidate drug for treatment of patients suffering MERS or COVID-19.

80	The candidate peptides were designed by applying to viral antigens a technology used for personalized vaccination in cancer, based on long neoantigen peptides, currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy. Technical details of the approach used are detailed below: We identified multiepitope peptide vaccine candidates against nCov that can potentially trigger both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune response. The approach that we used for designing potential peptide vaccine candidates takes a more personalized strategy, referred to as vaccinomics , which enables the selection of target viral proteins with low mutation rates, and the design of peptides tuned to the immune characteristics of the target populations, variable based on geographic location and ethnicity. Based on the human MHC (human leukocyte antigen) allele variation, the peptide vaccines can be made more relevant to a community or individual. The selection of the peptides that could act as vaccines is determined by the binding of the processed viral peptide with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules, and the relevant HLA alleles.

92	Here, we correlated protein-level mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus to clinical outcome. Conclusions We demonstrate that mutations in the viral genes may have a direct correlation to clinical outcome. Mutations correlated to mild outcome were located in the ORF8, NSP6, ORF3a, NSP4, and in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N. Mutations associated with inferior outcome were located in the surface (S) glycoprotein, in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, in the 3-to5 exonuclease, in ORF3a, NSP2 and N. Mutations leading to severe outcome with low prevalence were found in the surface (S) glycoprotein and in NSP7. Our results help to quickly identify SARS-CoV-2 infections harboring mutations related to severe outcome.	Different mutations in SARS-CoV-2 associate with severe and mild outcome

229	Following the necessary approvals from regulators, as well as the national ministry of health, and Kilifi county, the first volunteers for the trial have recently received their vaccinations. The trial in Kenya will initially involve 40 frontline workers in Kilifi County. Professor Andy Pollard, Director of the Oxford Vaccine Group and Chief Investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial, said: Were excited to see our colleagues in Kenya today joining those around the world in helping us to evaluate the ChAdOx1 nCov-2019 Oxford coronavirus vaccine, as it is important to evaluate the vaccine in as many different populations as possible.

230	Model predictions fail because the observed infection rates are beyond modeling: any model that uses fixed rates or uses memory or averages of past rates cannot reproduce the data on active infections. SUMMARYREFERENCES The pandemic infection rates to two to three decimal places are an example of complexity: the infection rates can be calculated daily from the infections but they cannot be modeled and predicted from fixed initial conditions. Second, model building does not and cannot reflect real epidemic data because the only correct rates emerge day by day in the daily data, cannot be usefully forecast for more than a few days in advance, and cannot be forecast at all correctly near a peak.	Pandemic infection rates are deterministic but can not be modeled

293	As illustrated in the COVID-19 study, while public health officials must work quickly to understand how a new virus functions, without appropriate testing or coordinated response strategies the risk grows for infections to go unreported. The study provides insight into how limited testing and gaps in surveillance during the initial phase of the epidemic resulted in so many cases going undetected. The potential for misdiagnosis and the limitations of surveillance are huge issues across infectious diseases, especially emerging infectious diseases, he added.	Gaps in early surveillance of coronavirus led to record-breaking US trajectory

307	These observations led us to hypothesize that Brd4-bound enhancers might underlie sex differences in stem cell function and tumorigenicity in GBM. We report that sex-biased Brd4 activity drive sex differences in GBM and render male and female tumor cells differentially sensitive to BET inhibitors. These sex- biased gene expression patterns were also evident in human glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). In an established isogenic murine model of glioblastoma, we discovered correlated transcriptome-wide sex differences in gene expression, H3K27ac marks, large Brd4-bound enhancer usage, and Brd4 localization to Myc and p53 genomic binding sites. Thus, for the first time, Brd4 activity is revealed to drive a sex differences in stem cell and tumorigenic phenotype, resulting in diametrically opposite responses to BET inhibition in male and female GBM cells.

321	Last month, the FDA posted updated templates with recommendations for test developers to demonstrate validation for a test to be authorized for screening of asymptomatic people, as well as for sample pooling. The FDA reissued the LabCorp COVID-19 RT-PCR Test EUA to expand use of the test to anyone, after the company provided scientific data showing the tests ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a general, asymptomatic population. Additionally, the data reviewed by the FDA demonstrated that the test is as accurate in the broader asymptomatic population as it is among people suspected to have COVID-19. Until now, molecular diagnostic tests have generally been authorized for people suspected of having COVID-19 by their health care provider, which has allowed asymptomatic people to be tested, when warranted, at the discretion of the health care provider.

But a small number of people with antibodies may still be able to carry and transmit COVID-19 according to the study. iStock London, January 14 An official UK study released on Thursday concludes that a past COVID-19 infection provides some immunity for at least five months, but people may still carry and transmit coronavirus.

366	Vaccines expose the immune system to components of a virus  the coronavirus spike protein, in the case of nearly all COVID-19 vaccines  in the hope of teaching it how to react against a real infection in the future. In the past few days, scientists working at feverish pace to develop vaccines against the coronavirus have released a flood of data from their first human trials. The vaccine is inducing the kind of immune responses that we think are inducing protection against coronavirus, said Sarah Gilbert, a vaccinologist co-leading the Oxford effort, in a press briefing announcing the results. But they suggest that the candidate vaccines are broadly safe, and offer the first hints that vaccines can summon immune responses similar to those of people who have been infected with the virus. Its definitely plausible that theres more than one way to protect against this virus. The nature of the immune response that protects  or fails to protect  against COVID-19 will become clearer when efficacy trials deliver their first results.

383	Finally, RT-qPCR primers are designed to amplify the target regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Once virus mutation and recombination occur, it is difficult to effectively diagnose viral infection by existing RT-qPCR primers. There may be selective mutations in SARS-CoV-2, and it is necessary to avoid certain regions when designing primers and probes. The large- scale sustained person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has led to many mutational events, some of which may affect the sensitivity and specificity of available PCR assays (2). A mutation in a reverse primer has been shown to affect the sensitivity of an RT-qPCR assay in use early in the pandemic10 and further mutations could lead to the occurrence of false negative results, particularly if the mutation occurs at the extreme 3 end of the primers.	A novel point mutation in the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 may affect the detection of the virus by RT-qPCR.
