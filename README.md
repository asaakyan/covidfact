# COVID-Fact

This repository contains data and code for our ACL 2021 paper 

                  COVID-Fact: Fact Extraction and Verification of Real-World Claims on COVID-19 Pandemic
                  Arkadiy Saakyan, Tuhin Chakrabarty, and Smaranda Muresan.

The full dataset is contained in the file COVIDFACT_dataset.jsonl. Every line is a dictionary with the following the format below:

{"claim": "claim text", "label": "REFUTED or SUPPORTED", "evidence": [list of evidence sentences], "gold_source": "link", "flair": "post's flair"}

# Evidence Selection
The script used for evidence selection / claim filtration can be found in the folder doc_selection. There is also the script to select evidence for a particular claim. 

# Counter-claim Generation
The scripts used for counter-claim generation can be found in the folder contrastive_gen. get_attn_model.py is used to find the best head and layer of a fine-tuned BERT uncased model. get_top_words.py is used to obtain the salient words for a particular set of claims. Finally, gen_contrast_claims.py is used to replace salient words by outputs generated by RoBERTA fine-tuned on CORD-19.

# Evaluation
The folder evaluation provides the scripts needed to recreate Table 4 and Table 5 of the paper. eval_data folder provides the dataset already processed in the format necessary for the experiments.

# Citation
TBD
